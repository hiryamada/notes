1,1,2011-11-01,"Excellent all the way around. The host was an excellent host and kindly invited me to movie night on my last evening in the apartment. The apartment's warm and modern design and furnishings cannot be fully appreciated with photos. I am a Seattle native and this part of Queen Anne is one of the best parts of the hill.The extremely private front porch/deck area hides behind a lush bamboo screen but a view of Elliott Bay and Puget Sound is three steps out into the welcoming yard. Very close to major transit lines and ample on-street parking for your vehicle makes traveling south into downtown (15 minutes, tops, to Pike Place Market by car, not much more by bus!!!) and traveling north across the historic Ship Canal into Ballard (which is far cooler than downtown Seattle) is almost instantaneous. If you want to live like a native, connected to the city and the sea, give The host's space a week or two."
2,1,2011-11-04,"The host's apartment was a wonderful place to stay! Extremely comfy and relaxing with a beautiful view. The location is very convenient and close to a lot of things to do, weather you have a car or are taking the bus around town. I would recommend anyone traveling, weather for business or pleasure, that this is a great spot with a great host!"
3,1,2011-11-08,"One of the most pleasant stays I've had in my travels. The host is wonderful!"
4,1,2011-11-14,"The host's suite is beautiful, cozy and conveniently located. I love that armchair! One tip: when she offers you detailed directions: take them, especially if you're arriving after dark! ;)"
5,1,2011-11-19,"Our stay was short and pleasant. With its own porch space the flat boosts a lot of privacy! Wish we could have made it in summer to barbecue."
6,1,2011-11-23,"I had a wonderful 4 night stay in this apartment. The place is crisp and clean and in a fantastic location. Walking around the Queen Anne neighborhood each day showed the real charm of Seattle and I hope I have a chance to stay again!"
7,1,2011-11-27,"The apartment was really nice and homey. It was located in a good area. The host was very friendly. It was just right for our little family. We would love to stay there again on another visit to Seattle."
8,1,2011-11-30,"I stayed here for 3 days and had no problems with the house or the owner. One of my fren decided to join us at the last minute and The host had no problems with the extra person. The house was pretty comfortable for us and was as described in the ad. We found parking near the house always and the location is great as its just a 15 min ride to downtown. I would be willing to stay here again when visting Seattle."
9,1,2011-12-05,"I did booking for my sister, and she liked the place very much. It is conveniently located, comfortable and private."
10,1,2011-12-09,"We were unintentionally poor guests; we broke the cork screw and stayed an extra day thinking that we had actually rented for 3 instead of 2 days. The host was kind and cool and collected. Very nice apartment!We would rent it again if she allowed us back...."
11,1,2011-12-14,"the apartment is spacious, comfortable, and very usable - nice simple decor. as walkers the location was perfect - but if required a bus stop was never far away. lower queen anne, ballard, and the fremont neighborhoods are all quite accessible. take the walk over queen anne hill via kerry park with its view of the city and down to the the waterfront art park and bell town."
12,1,2011-12-20,"The host was very welcoming to us. She showed us around the apartment and handed us the keys. We were on our own the rest of the stay. We basically just needed a place to stay for a friend's wedding, so we really did not stay at the apt the whole time, only to sleep. Everything was smooth. Found the place right away and it was about a 5-10 minute drive from her place to Pike's Place Market. There is a Whole Foods market and a Pete's Cafe down the hill from her. Definitely need a car.If you are a light sleeper, don't know if the noise from the walking on the floors above, would bother you. You can pretty much hear everything.Very nice stay and great price! Thanks for hosting us!"
13,1,2011-12-30,"We stayed in this wonderful space for two days. The host provided detailed directions to the flat, as it can be difficult to find. Everything is as described, but better in person. The apartment itself is very private and clean, with ample free(!) street parking. The rooms are beautifully simple, with artful decor and an open layout. Noise was not an issue for us. The location is central and a close drive or decent walk to everything Seattle has to offer. We would love to stay there again in the future."
14,1,2012-01-10,"My husband, mom and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay at the apartment. It was clean, peaceful and very comfortable. There was minimal noise from the footsteps upstairs, and you wouldn't know there is a busy road just down the hill. The location was a little difficult to find at first, but it didn't take long to sort out. The bed was more comfy than any swanky hotel room's and my mom was very comfortable on the fold-out futon in the living area -- with a nice, plush comforter and pillows provided. Our host even stocked hot tea to prepare with a kettle on the stove -- a very welcome treat as it was cold and damp outside that weekend. We are looking forward to staying there again on our next visit to Seattle!"
15,1,2012-01-13,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed the lovely space. The apartment is very functional\ private, quiet; good kitchen layout, comfortable bed, everything we needed. Had a small glitch with the internet connection but we were able to resolve it with the host's help. The host was good about responding to our questions, and flexible on our arrival and departure details. FYI, the location is slightly off the beaten track and requires climbing some stairs, so not so good if you don't have a car or have mobility challenges -- but for us it was perfect."
16,1,2012-01-16,"I was very comfortable at the apartment. A great overall experience and she really went out of her way to provide some good recommendations."
17,1,2012-01-30,"This was a perfect spot for our stay! We needed access to the Arts Center and it was a beautiful walk along the scenic Highland Drive. We found the apartment charming, very comfortable and a perfect price!"
18,1,2012-02-10,"We absolutely adored this lovely apartment! It was the perfect spot to help us ease into the Seattle community upon our relocation to Seattle from N.Y. while waiting for our things to arrive..."
34,1,2012-09-07,"What a fantastic space to call home-base while visiting Seattle. Great location, the host was a pleasure and the space was perfect- just like in the pictures, mid-century mod and the bed was soooo comfortable! We had our privacy but the host responded right away when we had questions. Easy to park on the street out front and such a perfect example of the pleasures of Seattle living. We were even able to host a little dinner barbeque on the patio in front of the space. I will definitely be back if I can!"
35,1,2012-09-10,"It was a lovely, very comfortable apartment with a nice outside porch and total privacy. The host was very accomodating as I wanted to invite our niece to stay with us on the second night. We didn't use the kitchen, but it was fully equipped and we could have cooked a dinner there had we wanted to. I highly recommend it. Only downside would be if someone needed a railing to go down the back stairs.. There isn't one."
19,1,2012-02-20,"Great apartment in Seattle, very comfortable. The host was great and answered all of our questions. We did not have any problems and really enjoyed our stay. Parking is on street, but there were always spots available. The neighborhood felt very safe and we had no problems leaving our rental car out of sight even though we were a little paranoid since they gave us a much more expensive car than we had expected!We had no trouble finding the place, and although it is not in the most walkable area it is pretty centrally located and there is a Whole Foods nearby for supplies. Although you can hear footsteps from above, it was not an issue for us at all and I tend to have sleep issues. Also a bonus: plenty of hot water! Nice, as is can get pretty chilly in Seattle, and there is only one heater in the apartment (and it took us a while to figure out we had to turn it wayyy up to get enough heat!) One reviewer did mention that this is not the place for you if you have mobility issues and I agree: the steps that lead to the apartment are wooden & with the rain can get slippery, and there is no railing. It's probably best for a couple if you want privacy since there is no door to the bedroom, just a curtain, and the bathroom is through the bedroom.Overall we had a great stay here and would not hesitate to return."
20,1,2012-02-24,"The host welcomed us warmly and provided lots of materials about Seattle. She was a very gracious host. The apartment was great -- everything was extremely clean and comfortable, and she had added a lot of decorative touches. Queen Anne was a great neighborhood, and it was a short drive to downtown Seattle. There was plenty of street parking."
21,1,2012-04-08,"It was great! Has an incredible host. We and our kids stayed there and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Was maybe a two minute walk to the bus stop (if that) and everything was just as The host describes it. We have recommended her place to family we have that live in the area for when they have company from out of town that they don't have room for. We would stay there again if in the area."
22,1,2012-05-30,"My husband and I visited Seattle for a conference and had a great time staying at this flat. The apartment has got a great vibe and she's stocked it with all the trappings to make cooking, sightseeing and snoozing a breeze. We had easy access (via rental car) to downtown and the host offered some good tips for local restaurants, shopping, hiking and live music. And, while staying in her quiet neighborhood with a view of the golf course from the patio and Whole Foods just down the street, we felt right at home during our stay!"
23,1,2012-06-07,"My college age daughter and I spent a week in this apartment. Although it's the bottom of the house, kind of a daylight basement, there was enough light and a lovely view on the back porch into vegetation and the garden and a farther view to the driving range at Interbay. It worked perfectly for us and we slept well on the queen size bed (me) and the futon bed (daughter.) Loved the spacious kitchen. The garden is lovely and the apartment is quiet and cozy. Parking is very scarce in the evening on the street but because of the oddity of that part of Queen Anne, you can usually find parking on the upper level of the street and just come back down via stairs in the middle of the block. The host is a welcoming, easygoing accommodating host and made us feel instantly at home. At the same time, we had all the privacy we needed."
24,1,2012-06-18,"The apartment was comfortable and spacious. Very comfy bed. All the essentials in kitchen and bath. Very clean. Great internet. Good privacy. Very convenient location. Charming side entry garden area that leads to the basement apartment. Our college age daughter was able to stay with us a couple nights on the futon couch in the living area. The host was delightful. We appreciated her quick responds to pre -arrival communications and her ready availability the day of check in."
25,1,2012-06-26,"Great apartment conveniently located. We really enjoyed the garden setting. The host has nicely appointed the apartment with everything from laundry detergent to travel brochures to condiments in the kitchen. It was a very peaceful place to return to after a long day of sight-seeing. The parking was a little dicey but we did learn how to parallel park on the left side of the road!"
26,1,2012-06-28,"Very nice, clean, comfortable and convenient. Ideal for a couple, but room for one more if needed. The host was very helpful and accomodating."
27,1,2012-07-07,"This worked out quite nicely for our family. The location was convenient via car to both downtown and Ballard. The bed was very comfortable, the futon worked nicely for our kids and the bathroom, while small, was nice with a good shower. The kitchen was also quite usable and nice. Laundry facilities were available with little hassle. The floor is a bit thin, so if you are hypersensitive about noise (which we are not), the occassional walking of the people above might be a detraction. Host was readily accessible via email during our stay and helped us figure out the wifi access."
28,1,2012-07-10,"It was great to have our own apartment while in Seattle. Apartment was clean had cable tv and internet access. The host was a friendly host that welcomed us and then left us alone. She was available to us if we had questions about sites. Her beautiful cat came the next day to greet us and check out who was in her garden apartment. We would recommend this apartment and host to anyone seeking lodging while in the Seattle area. Public bus service was down the street from this apartment. Whole Foods within walking distance and golf course across the street. House hard to find because front or entrance to house is on 14th Street."
29,1,2012-07-26,"Just as advertised. Stylish, comfortable, with privacy and conveniently located within easy walking distance to cafes, Whole Foods, etc. Clean, neat, utilitarian. Low ceiling beam to be aware of for those over 6' 3\ but worth the price of admission. Very economical given location and amenities. The host makes it easy to locate, move in and feel completely at home without being intrusive. I'll be back."
30,1,2012-07-31,"Great location, short drive to everything! Our stay was very comfortable this place had everything we needed, so nice to have the comforts of home. The host was very reachable when we needed something. I highly recommend this place!"
31,1,2012-08-08,"The patio view faces the sunset and is beautiful, great garden patio, the grill is a great touch. It's right on the bus line. Comfortable bed. If you're a tv fan, this place has a LOT of channels! The host responded quickly to any questions or concerns and you get a lot of privacy. Located in a great neighborhood very close to downtown and Seattle Center."
32,1,2012-08-19,"We were here for only two nights and out most of the day between, but we found the apartment to be exactly what it looked like in the photos and exactly what we were looking for: a cool, contemporary, sparsely but tastefully decorated and furnished retreat from the demands of our kids and their kids (love them as we do). We were very comfortable. The host is a charming young woman who was very helpful in accommodating our arrival needs and our other questions. We loved this place and would recommend it to our friends."
33,1,2012-08-28,"Loved our stay there, everything so clean and a beautiful scenery, the host was very welcoming and made sure we were at comfort. thanks so much, what a cozy place."
36,1,2012-09-20,"Great space. Great location. Easy to get to and easy to get around. Will definitely be my first choice next time I'm in Seattle."
37,1,2012-09-25,"Stylish, comfortable space, convenient location, and a friendly, easy going host made this a great home base for our Seattle adventures. We appreciated the laundry facilities and good water pressure in the shower, too. The garden space was lovely to walk through as we came and went, and we felt quite at home in no time. No hesitation in recommending this place!"
38,1,2012-10-26,"This is a very cool spot, spacious, well appointed and private and truly my new favorite rental place in Seattle. The host communicates well and is a conscientious host. Certainly a place I would recommend."
39,1,2012-10-31,"Thanks for a really comfortable stay in Queen Anne! Though that hill can be a pain to climb if you're taking the bus, it was worth the stay in the apartment. The bed and futon couch were extremely comfortable. It was like sleeping on a cloud. It's close to public transit to Downtown and Fremont. A ten minute walk to a yummy burger place called Red Mill, a Starbucks and a QFC Grocery Store (CA Residents: Ralphs!) One of my favorite things about the apartment was hearing the rain outside on the garden. The light switch in the bathroom was a little tricky but I think they had an electrician coming in the day we left to poke around. Thanks again for a great time in Seattle!"
40,1,2012-11-07,"The host's apartment was in a great location to spend the weekend in Seattle. The apartment was clean and had more than enough room for two. The host was prompt in her responses and gave great directions. I would stay here again."
41,1,2012-11-12,"We had a beautiful time in Seattle, walked Everywhere and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The place is clean, elegant, welcoming and very well equipped for four. The host, while we never met her in person, due to our taking in of the town was a communicative and gracious host.We'll be back!"
42,1,2012-11-18,"For my first stay in Seattle, The host's apartment was wonderful! It was shared between a friend and I, and it was private, quiet, and a nice resting spot to come home to after sightseeing all day. The apartment made me feel like a local, and the neighborhood was lovely.It was close to public transportation and very easy to navigate to and from downtown and other neighborhoods. The host was easy to get into contact with and a pleasant person to deal with. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
43,1,2012-11-20,"The one bedroom apartment was clean with central heating already started for us. It was warm and very inviting with a nice nightlight view from the private veranda. We enjoyed making breakfast in the cozy kitchen before we started our day. It was initially a bit difficult to find the place but we had great communication with our host. We rented a car to get around. Street parking was tight but we didn't have any trouble finding a spot and parking was free! We would definitely book again!!"
44,1,2012-11-27,"My family and I stayed here for a week over Thanksgiving. We had a great time. The host was always prompt in replying to any inquiry we had. She gave great directions to find her place. The apartment was homey. The location was convenient to downtown Seattle. We'll stay there again."
45,1,2012-12-03,"My husband and I had a great stay. The apartment is very clean, comfortable, and attractive. The suite is very private, and has it's own little patio, which would be lovely in the summer. The host was very communicative and friendly. Some minor drawbacks include: the suite has very low ceilings, which might be a problem for tall people; it might be a challenge to stay there without a car, as it was a 10 min. drive to downtown and not very close to a commercial area. That being said, we would definitely stay again."
46,1,2012-12-09,"The apartment was clean and peaceful. It's very convenient to public transportation. Whole Foods is a short walk nearby, although there are no restaurants within easy walking distance. The host made the whole process very easy. I would definitely recommend her place to others."
47,1,2012-12-12,"Sweet, clean, pleasant and well-appointed apt. Close to public transportation to downtown, nice outside porch. Great experience overall! Would definitely stay there again, and recommend to others."
48,1,2012-12-16,"It was a fantastic place to stay, really quiet and close to everything downtown. We would stay here again in a heart beat. The host was very helpful with everything. The place was very spacious and had everything that someone would need. First time as rental user, it was awesome. Got more than I expected."
49,1,2012-12-23,"Lovely, well appointed space. I liked the style...the comfort and the well thought out furnishings etc.. I recommend this site."
50,1,2013-02-05,"The host is very friendly and we had a lovely time staying at this apartment! The location is secretly tucked in the back in a very quiet neighborhood that is literally 5-10 minutes away from the Seattle Center, Downtown Seattle, Ballard, Fremont, Capitol Hill, etc. This apartment was very clean and spacious, and the furnishings were carefully laid out that provided an enjoyable experience. Things to note: - Very low ceilings and I'm five feet tall so this suite will definitely be a problem for tall people. - Parking was easy unless you're coming back home after 10pm where you might only have to walk for a minute or two to the apartment. I can't complain too much since it's free parking!- Toilet needs to be flushed twice, no matter if it was your light or heavy load.Overall, great stay and I would consider renting this place again in the future! Thanks!"
51,1,2013-02-22,"We had an excellent time at the apartment...a wonderful quiet place in a great location."
52,1,2013-02-26,"Stayed here with our two small kids. Loved the location, clean safe space."
53,1,2013-02-26,"We enjoyed a comfortable 2 nights. Thank you for your helpful travel instructions to locate the property and also for useful tips on how to enjoy an interesting area of Seattle. We had convenient free street parking and the location was an easy drive to downtown Seattle. Very private and quiet with a comfortable bed and good kitchen facilities. We would love to return to enjoy the patio and private garden when the Summer weather arrives!"
54,1,2013-03-04,"It was a pleasant stay. The apartment was neat, beautiful and private."
55,1,2013-03-07,"The place is really nice and spacious. It's basically a separate 1 bed flat underneath here own house (not in a basement as it's build on a hill) with kitchen, living space and you can use the washing/drying machines, which is very convenient.The area is an affluent residential area and there're relatively good connections into town and other nice areas like Ballard. The host is very nice and interaction is smooth. I'd recommend this place to everyone and this is really good value."
78,1,2013-08-13,"This lovely apartment was a wonderful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Seattle. It was truly amazing to return home each day to such a relaxing environment, particular at sunset when we were able to take in stunning pink and orange skies from her cozy porch facing the water."
79,1,2013-08-30,"Great host with a cool spot in Queen Anne. We really enjoyed our stay there."
56,1,2013-03-15,"I had an excellent experience in Seattle. This was my first time using rental, and I couldn't be happier. For half the price of a hotel, I got my own apartment. It's cute, well-maintained, and clean. The host was unobtrusive and helpful. The location is a little hike from amenities, with restaurants a mile or so up the hill, and the grocery about a half mile down the road, but it's doable. The apartment has low-ish ceilings, so if you're super tall this may not be the place for you. Stoked on my experience. I'd definitely stay here again."
57,1,2013-04-02,"She responded so quickly to almost every email and text message, was very courteous and kind. The Apartment was just great and, although a bit confusing to find, was a perfect city hideaway, complete with a bamboo grove out the front windows."
58,1,2013-04-14,"The apartment in Queen Anne is a very serene place to live in. I was pleasantly surprised that it is tucked in a very safe and quiet neighborhood. The host provided very succinct details on how to get to her place and was very friendly and respecting of my privacy through my entire stay.The entire apartment is clean and tidy, the kitchen is ample with utensils, the bedroom is just downright comfortable. There was a few mornings when I had trouble waking up because it was as comfy as a hotel bed!Thank you for the great experience! I recommend staying at her place if you're looking for a no hassle stay!"
59,1,2013-04-28,"Lovely place but very noisy in the evening. Not to recommend to people who do not want their sleep to be affected."
60,1,2013-05-03,"We loved our stay! Great location - very easy to get around all the different neighborhoods of Seattle. The place was perfect for us- very comfortable and clean, close to Trader Joe's/Whole Foods and full kitchen to stock everything. If you have your own car - you can find a parking spot relatively close by (if not directly in front) which is excellent for Seattle. Last but not least, the host was a gracious and accommodating host. We highly recommend her place!"
61,1,2013-05-09,"My husband and I had a pleasant stay. She was a gracious host. Her place is quaint and clean. It was conveniently located (Trader Joe's, Whole Foods Market, Starbucks, Pike's Place, and downtown). Aloha from Hawaii May 2013"
62,1,2013-05-12,"I really enjoyed stayingin the apartment. The bed was really comfortable and there was also a comfortable sofa bed. The location was very convenient and street parking was not too difficult. The host was a great host and made us feel welcome. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when I come back to Seattle"
63,1,2013-05-17,"This apt is so well kept and beautiful and in such a perfect location!!!! It's quiet and secluded and the kitchen is well equipped. What a perfect place to stay"
64,1,2013-05-24,"Very comfy and spacious. The host was very quick to respond. Apartment was well appointed. Nice towels and there was always street parking available close to the house. You can hear a lot of road noise./traffic so that may bother you if you are not used to it. Other than that everything was great and I would stay here again."
65,1,2013-05-28,"the apartment was great and provided perfect accommodationsfor our needs. the only comment as an improvement tomake it more comfortable/safe/secure feeling is to have windowcoverings that completely block out seeing into the space. neither my travel partner and I are comfortable with close next door living quarters being able to have full view into our 'living' space. also, hard to sleep past daybreak with morning light not blocked out fully. love the look of bamboo reed coverings, just not the coverage they provide on their own. other than that, the communication was great, we were left to our own devices (like), the space was exactly as offered, street parking was available easily. would love to stay here again when in seattle."
66,1,2013-06-09,"Very cute place in great location, our stay could not have been better!"
67,1,2013-06-13,"Very nice place to stay, optimal location. I don't think there are better deals for staying in Seattle!"
68,1,2013-06-15,"The apartment was spacious and very nice. Had a little trouble initially finding her home and parking but generally all was very convenient and very pleasant. We only saw her on that first day of two days/nights. Would have liked to thank her in person that last day but instead, emailed our thanks. Would recommend to friends who are traveling to Seattle."
69,1,2013-06-23,"The place had everything we needed for our visit. It was a clean, comfortable little apartment. The host was quick to reply, she was really sweet and professional to work with. We would love to rent again next time we are in Seattle! Thanks! Donna and Clint Schnecksville PA"
70,1,2013-06-27,"The apartment is a walk out basement unit that is very clean and super cozy! It's a little hard to find at first, but once you do, it's smooth sailing. The bed was comfortable and street parking was easy to find in our rental car."
71,1,2013-07-06,"This place was perfect for us. The apartment was spotless, roomy and very comfortable. We enjoyed the sunny deck in the late afternoons. The host was very accommodating and responded promptly when I called or texted her with questions. This is definitely the first place I will look for the next trip to Seattle. We had a wonderful time there! We didn't want to leave! Great location and very private."
72,1,2013-07-09,"Great value and interesting digs in a quiet and cute Seattle neighborhood. My wife Nancy and I recommend this place for anyone."
73,1,2013-07-18,"Great location for acclimatization the first two days in the US. Parking in front of the house. Separate private entrance, we met the host only at our arrival. Well equiped appartment.Closed to Queen Anne restaurants and shops."
74,1,2013-07-27,"Everything could not have been easier! The apartment was clean and comfortable - and a great central location. Definitely glad we stayed in the apartment rather than a hotel."
75,1,2013-07-31,"Wonderful space in a convenient location. The host was very accommodating of our schedule and our kids. A super experience all the way around. THANKS!!!!"
76,1,2013-08-04,"We had a very pleasant experience! The apartment was clean, tidy and had everything we could have required during our stay. We only got to meet/speak with the host in passing, but she was lovely and a very accommodating hostess! I'd definitely stay here again if I were to return to the area. Thanks!"
77,1,2013-08-11,"We stayed for a week, and the suite was wonderful-- we spent many happy hours sitting on the porch/terrace admiring the landscaping and just relaxing. The suite was very clean, and well supplied with linens, towels, dishes, etc. (with one exception-- would have loved a toaster!). We saw the host mostly in passing, as she was gardening or coming in or out, but she was very prompt with returning any texts or emails and answering our questions. Would certainly recommend her suite to anyone who wants to spend some time in Seattle-- the location is excellent and you can be downtown very quickly, as it's close to a major road-- the downside of that is some traffic noise, but it quiets down at night. We were very happy with our time there and would definitely return."
114,10,2014-07-21,"Beautiful home and comfortable. Wish it was more walking distance to downtown ballard"
80,1,2013-09-09,"We had a great stay at the apartment. The apartment was very clean and well appointed. Being its own self-contained space it felt just as private as having our own hotel room or apartment. Having the kitchen available was a great way to save some money on eating out as well. Concerning others' comments about the reed window blinds not offering enough privacy, there are accordion-style window shades hung behind the reed blinds which you can lower for complete privacy. The host was very helpful and responsive to any questions we had. Being a lifelong resident of Seattle she was a great resource for questions we had about the town itself. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again. Overall, it was a great experience and just what we needed for our trip."
81,10,2013-10-14,"We LOVED staying at this house!!! It is so adorable and impeccably clean. Such warm hosts- they left us local beer and some snacks! And they gave us some helpful info about the neighborhood, which is fantastic with many restaurants, bars, and really cute shops. Every room of the house is great, and we especially loved that the living room has a fireplace and record player which we were welcomed to use. We took advantage of that and had an amazing Washington experience. I'd definitely recommend this booking!!"
82,1,2013-10-18,"Our family had a wonderful time in this Queen Anne apartment. The room was clean and exactly as pictured. The neighborhood was quiet and it was an easy 20-30 minute bus/walk to downtown. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone planning a Seattle visit."
83,1,2013-10-29,"The place was perfect for a couple to spend the weekend in Seattle! It was quiet, spacious, comfortable and affordable. And the view was SICK!!. The host was a great host to us from the beginning. Our flight didn't land in Seattle until around 11PM and she stayed up all night waiting for us to arrive. And when we did, she greeted us at the door. She was very responsive to any text/messages I sent and was very polite and respectful. My girlfriend and i had a fantastic stay and we would do it again in a heartbeat! Thank you so much!"
84,1,2013-11-02,"The place was nicely located right off a central avenue and in a great neighborhood. The host was very accommodating to our travel schedule which was a great help. The streets are a little tough to navigate (but that's all of Seattle) and parking can be tight (especially in the evening) but it usually works out alright. It's a great place especially if you're on a budget as it has a bed and a futon as well as a nice little kitchen."
85,1,2013-12-01,"We recently moved to Seattle and stayed in this apartment while we searched for a perm place to live. From start to finish our stay couldn't have been better. The apartment was very comfortable for the two of us. It was beautifully decorated and nicely appointed. Internet was super fast and reliable, cleaning supplies/linens were always stocked, and the laundry room was very convenient. Also parking was no problem at all - on the rare days when we couldn't find a spot right in front of the house, we didn't have to go far for another. The neighborhood was perfectly positioned - close the the D bus, which will get you to many neighborhoods: Downtown, Lower Queen Anne, Fremont, Ballard...You can also hike up the hill to the boutiques, restaurants and coffee shops of Upper Queen Anne, taking in the beautiful houses and gardens along the way. The host was super nice, laid back and responsive throughout our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!"
86,10,2013-12-02,"We had a great stay at this apartment over Thanksgiving holiday. The beds were cozy, the kitchen was well stocked with all the necessary gadgets, and the location was perfect. Just a five minute walk to the heart of Ballard, and right across the street from the Ballard Market, key in last minute food pick-ups. Our only gripe was there was a condo construction site directly next door. Construction began promptly at 7am every morning, making it impossible to get some extra sleep-in time on our vacation. I would definitely stay here again."
87,1,2013-12-04,"This was a really lovely apartment to stay in while in Seattle!"
88,1,2013-12-10,"This place was fantastic for me and 3 friends who went to Seattle for vacation (me to see Pearl Jam close out their tour). We had absolutely no complaints and communication with the host was wonderful. Location is Perfect for getting around Seattle. We took advantage of the BBQ grill even though it was cold out. A top notch vacation rental experience."
89,1,2013-12-11,"A delightful little place. Cute and quirky but everything you need. Careful if you are a very tall person as the ceiling is low in some places."
90,1,2013-12-15,"The space is lovely, clean, peaceful and private. We particularly enjoyed the sense of calmness permeating the space. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows, and we liked the spaciousness of the apartment. We hope to return in warmer weather! Only quirk we encountered was a somewhat temperamental toilet, but it was no big deal. And, although the address is on Gilman, the door seems to be on14th, which took some getting used to. We enjoyed walking up the hill (take the stairs whenever possible!) to Macrina Bakery at the top of Queen Anne."
91,1,2013-12-17,"The host was a great host, answered questions promptly and the accommodations were very comfortable."
92,1,2013-12-20,"The apartment was such a treat to stay in. Not only did it have all the comforts of home, but it also had the most delightful details that really made me want to stay in rather than go out! Queen Anne is such a great neighbourhood, and is located perfectly for strolls around the hill. I would recommend you stay here if you want to enjoy the neighbourhood and have a cosy, private and beautiful space to stay in during your stay in Seattle."
93,1,2013-12-27,"I highly recommend this place. It was quiet and private. I was surprise with her attention to detail. She has little things in the apartment that just makes you feel at home. I stayed for a week and was able to run to the gym in the morning and walk to the grocery store. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Seattle."
94,1,2013-12-31,"My wife and I really enjoyed our time here. Super comfortable place to relax. In terms of location, if you come by car, you can't beat it. Five to ten minute drive to downtown, five minutes to Ballard, absolutely a convenient place. Great restaurants very nearby in Ballard. Saved a bit of money by taking out and eating at home which was awesome. The host was super friendly and knowledgeable about the neighbour. Thank you! We will be back again!"
95,1,2014-01-01,"We loved our stay at this apartment! The host was friendly, quick to get back to us, clear with directions and information and very accommodating. The apartment itself was stylish, a great size for two people, clean and adorable overall. The neighborhood is cute and tucked away from loud city life but within walking distance of stores and cafes. We also loved the bamboo surrounding the patio and enjoyed eating breakfast among it. We will definitely stay again when we are in the Seattle area!"
145,4,2014-11-03,"We were disappointed with the property. The entry is in an alley which is not ideal, the door was damaged and appeared to be glued, and the property was not clean. The host was accommodating when we asked to have an additional guest stay at the property."
96,1,2014-03-27,"The host has a great little apartment. We had all the comforts we were hoping for, including everything we needed to prepare light meals. We planned this as a really touristy trip, committing our budget to entrance fees, etc, so being able to make breakfast and dinner was perfect. There is a QFC grocery store close by. We really enjoyed sitting on the covered porch with a beer in hand after walking miles around the city. Although we didn't take advantage, you can catch public transit pretty easily from here. We really appreciated the location as being right between Ballard and downtown, making day trips in any direction really convenient. Also, she has fun stencils for drawing and a \Finding Nemo\ dvd. Rad."
97,10,2014-03-31,"This place was in a fantastic location close to shops, great restaurants in Ballard and only a short distance to Freemont. The house was very cosy with everything we neededAs mentioned in the description, parking is a little hard to find out the front of the house but no real big deal in adjoining streets."
98,1,2014-04-04,"Staying in this apartment was amazing. She had all of the amenities a person could dream of - laundry, a closet with hangers, towels, extra linens - you can tell she put a lot of thought in putting together the space. We ended up cooking a lot and this apartment had a wonderfully stocked kitchen. It's a bit far away from restaurants and downtown, but Seattle is a gorgeous place to walk around and we had a great time hunting around for places in nearby Ballard, Fremont, and Capitol Hill!"
99,10,2014-04-04,"Great townhome right in the heart of Ballard, pictures are very accurate of the clean modern place. Was impressed that the owner called me during my stay to check on everything. The description accounts for the parking challenges, but only had to park down the street so no big deal. If you are looking for a 2br near the center of Ballard, this is a great choice!"
100,1,2014-04-06,"This is a beautiful apartment in a cute part of town. It's close to the arty Fremont District (cool statues, Theo chocolate factory), has some of it's own fantastic restaurants, and even houses a wonderful distillery worth checking out (Sound Spirits). The bed is remarkably comfortable, plenty of space, and a gorgeous garden if you're there during the day. The one caveat is this is a part of town with twisty streets and limited parking, so be aware it may take a moment to find a place to leave your car. Definitely keeping this place in my back pocket for my next trip."
101,1,2014-04-09,"What a wonderful experience. The host has a very beautiful place. It was exactly as she described. All our needs were met . It was very private and peaceful. This will be our home away from home in Seattle and we will recommend the place to our friends traveling to Seattle. Thank you so much!"
102,1,2014-04-17,"I had such a wonderful stay at this place--the perfect sanctuary to unwind after a long day. The property is absolutely beautiful, and the apartment is appointed with everything to create a feeling of a true home away from home. The kitchen is well equipped, so having the option to cook at home was an added bonus. The host was prompt in responding to any inquiries I had also.The house is within close proximity to public transportation, but be prepared for a bit of a hike up and down the hill in order to get to and from the bus station.I would most definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle!"
103,1,2014-05-01,"The host and her apartment were absolutely wonderful! The photos don't do the place justice! I wish we had more time to stay and chat, but she was a wonderful host - welcome at our Brooklyn home anytime. If you're looking for a quiet and beautiful place to stay in Seattle, I would definitely recommend this apartment!"
104,1,2014-05-05,"The place was perfect for our trip! Far enough from the hustle and bustle of the city, but close enough to get there in no time. We actually went back to the apartment in the middle of the day each day (rented a car) to take a break from exploring. We were basically 15 mins or less from everywhere! The apartment itself was very spacious, had a cute set-up, and a cozy feel to it. There's also a cool patio area designated for the space that overlooks the garden. The host was really friendly (not to mention very accomodating - our flight was delayed over 3 hours, arriving to her place at 2am!) and responded promptly. I would definitely stay here again!"
105,1,2014-05-08,"We had a wonderful experience. We had to reserve this apt in a hurry due to a family emergency and the host was very accommodating. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet her, but she was always responsive via text or email. The apt. is very cozy and spacious. We liked that it had a full kitchen. We had a car and parking was not a problem. All in all, we would definitely reserve again!"
106,1,2014-05-18,"This is a lovely sweet place. There's no privacy in the place - there are no doors that close between the bedroom and the living area. But if you don't need that, the common area is spacious for a small apartment, the kitchen has everything you need, the porch is lovely, and there's even a grill for BBQ if you want. The host was very accommodating."
107,1,2014-05-25,"The best of what Seattle has to offer. Our host was easy-going and the place was perfect. Top notch, hassle-free lodging."
108,1,2014-05-29,"This was a wonderful apartment! It was very true to the photos and very comfortable. The host did a great job setting up a place that has all the comforts of home. Even the little amenities like umbrellas and curling iron were nice touches! The kitchen is fully furnished, this is wifi, cable TV, and the outside ambiance (patio/garden) is lovely. The apartment is a short walk (less than 10 min) from a Whole Foods and several bus stops. It's a quiet neighborhood with awesome scenery (even a strawberry patch). The host was communicative throughout the entire process, easy to work with, and was even available for our late night arrival. I absolutely loved this stay and would come back again. Thanks!"
109,1,2014-07-05,"Our journey by plane went not as planned, which led to different arrival and in meeting the host later in the week. She is a friendly person. The neighbourhood is residential and very nice. Seattle is a true discovery. Vibrant. Great restaurants and super coffee and more. The apartment is spacious, compleet and clean. Price/quality OK"
110,10,2014-07-07,"Wonderful host. We had great communication leading up to and during our stay. She was wonderful about answering our questions quickly. The house was amazing, cute and so comfortable! The neighborhood conveniently within walking distance of a few restaurants and coffee! A very flexible and accomadating host. She even left us a hospitality basket! My family and I had a great time and felt right at home."
111,1,2014-07-08,"Wonderful, spotless, spacious apartment. Loved the outdoor sitting area. Would highly recommend it."
112,1,2014-07-13,"A great place to stay. The apartment had a great feel to it and was very comfortable. Furnishings were elegant and the futon was comfortable. Very well equipped kitchen."
113,1,2014-07-17,"We had a fantastic stay in Seattle at this lovely place. Really well situated for what we wanted to see and do - my only negative (which was our fault) was we only got up to the little shopping area a few blocks up on our last afternoon and just wished we had gone up there earlier in our stay. Thanks for all your help and certainly would come back and stay if we ever return to Seattle."
115,1,2014-07-22,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience at this apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. She was very accommodating to our travel plans (we were delayed nearly a day in our arrival, and our luggage came several hours later), and she has thought of absolutely everything you could need - a hairdryer, extra pillows and towels, a map of Seattle, access to a washer/dryer, even a curling iron! Our favorite parts were the full kitchen (we made our own breakfast every morning) and the lovely patio, which was private and secluded thanks to a wall of bamboo in the yard. The apartment is also in a convenient location in Queen Anne. We didn't have a car, but were able to easily get around using the bus system and a cab once or twice (to get to a wedding, which was a little farther away). We so enjoyed wandering around the various neighborhoods in Seattle, and the place is definitely in one of the best ones.Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would do it again/recommend it to others. For the price and place, you can't beat it."
116,1,2014-08-01,"My husband and I spent our honeymoon in Seattle and had an absolutely wonderful experience in this home! The apartment is in a beautiful section of Seattle and is close to everything you could imagine. We had all of the comforts of home...a kitchen, a place to do laundry (and believe me, after climbing Mt. Rainier and swimming in Sauk Valley we needed to), a coffee maker, a couch/chair/coffee table, wifi, cooking utensils, and a great shower. We felt like Seattle was home for us and enjoyed very much coming back every evening after a long day of adventure. We were greeted like old friends, treated with much respect, and felt very welcome. My husband bought some flowers for me at Pike's Market and I didn't have a vase. Her lovely roommate graciously gave me one and I enjoyed them the entire ten day visit. Queen Anne is a stunningly beautiful area of Seattle and is so much fun to explore on it's own. Just minutes from the grocery store, great restaurants, the bus line, and gorgeous Kerry Park, The host's home is the place to stay. I would highly recommend staying here. Thank you, so very much."
117,1,2014-08-04,"The host was an excellent host before and during our stay! The QA apartment is located on the west side of hilly QA in a gorgeous location overlooking the Magnolia neighborhood. There were four of us staying at the apartment and there was ample space to hang out and cook between our weekend activities. The private outdoor patio space was definitely an added bonus. One small thing to note that isn't evident in the pictures is the bathroom is located off of the bedroom - so you need to go through the bedroom to access it...not a big deal, but just something to keep in mind for guests sharing the space. If you're looking for a centrally located, stylish apartment, this definitely fits the bill!"
118,10,2014-08-11,"We had a wonderful trip and were lucky to stay in this lovely home! Everything was as described and the host was welcoming and helpful! It's also in our favorite Seattle neighborhood. We'll be back!"
119,1,2014-08-20,"The host was very welcoming and helped so much before our stay by answering all of the questions we had. Her home was beautiful and the view/surroundings made it so peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed staying there and had a great experience!"
120,10,2014-08-25,"The house was perfect. Ideally located with everything you would need for a stay. It was spotlessly clean and tidy and in a lovely neighbourhood. We didn't actually meet our hosts but we asked many questions before and during our stay about where to eat and the best ways to travel downtown and they were extremely helpful throughout. We were very impressed with Ballard itself. Great atmosphere about the place with lots of places to eat and some lovely shops. We visited the Woodland Zoo and Ballard Locks which are both nearby and definitely worth a visit and The Ballard Pizza Co was a great place to eat. Ballard market 2 minutes walk away was really good for groceries. We have no hesitation in recommending this house as somewhere to stay and would definitely use it again if we came back to Seattle."
121,1,2014-08-26,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment was lovely, clean, and exactly as shown in the photographs -- it had everything we needed. We particularly liked watching the sunset from the cozy patio.Thanks again.Ron & Karen (NZ)"
122,10,2014-08-31,"My family and I recently stayed in this town home and love it. It's beautifully decorated, clean and actually a little bit roomier than the pictures make it seem. The beds were very comfy. We loved the location and neighbourhood and can't wait to go back! Thanks for your help and hospitality."
123,1,2014-09-01,"Our host had everything ready for us to enjoy a pleasant stay. The suite was tidy, clean, and welcoming. There were fresh linen, towels, dishes and kitchen staples. Maps and city magazines were at hand. Several works of art were on subtle display; everywhere you looked, there was something pleasant to see. The house was surrounded by lush plantings, creating a tranquil oasis in an already quiet neighborhood."
124,10,2014-09-07,"My girlfriend and I had a very comfortable stay here with another couple. Everything was as described in the listing. Bonus points for the Stumptown coffee in the kitchen.We were in town for a wedding so didn't get to explore the immediate area, but it's very close to the Walrus and the Carpenter and some other good restaurants. Discovery Park is about 5 minutes away by car. Twenty minute drive to downtown. The host was incredibly responsive before and during the stay. I would stay here again."
125,1,2014-09-08,"We enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood is quiet and is easy to find parking. The host welcomed us as we arrived. Her apartment was very clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. She is very good at the art of feng shui. The artwork and small details of her apartment make it very welcoming. The garden and back porch of the apt was very peaceful. A charcoal grill is included so you stay at home and cook a meal if you wish. The apartment is within walking distance of the D-line bus, it will take you downtown within minutes. Overall it was a good experience. I would stay again."
126,1,2014-09-13,"Our stay was absolutely relaxing. The place we stayed at was very private which we enjoyed. Before going out to enjoy the night in Seattle we sat on the back porch and drank a glass of wine which was a perfect way to start the night. The private patio was full of plants which made our visit even more relaxing. The host was excellent at answering our questions via email and phone when we had questions to ask. The location was great and very easy to get to downtown Seattle. You only had to take one main stretch of road and you were there. I would highly recommend staying at this apartment."
183,1,2015-02-28,"It was so cute! My fiance and I wished we could have enjoyed the balcony and the yard but even with our quick trip in and out of Seattle, it really was a perfect little spot for us to retreat to at the end of some very long days. It was clean, coming and going was easy, her directions were perfect. We had no problems. If you have a car it's close enough to Ballard Ave -- The host was kind enough to offer up some recommendations for food. One thing I didn't ask about was parking, there is only street parking, and the first night took us a few rounds on roads nearby to find a spot, but we did get to the house pretty late."
127,1,2014-09-17,"The host' apartment is very nice but I have to note a major caveat. On the first morning in the apartment I slammed my head into a ceiling beam that separates one half of the unit from the other half. Needless to say this was both shocking and very painful. Afterwards I measured the beam and the bottom of it is just 5 feet 11 inches from the floor. As the beam is painted the same color as the walls, it doesn't really stand out. It's actually amazing that I'm the first guest this seems to have happened to. I'm 6 feet 1 inch and anyone under 5'11\ in shoes won't hit the beam, but anyone over that height needs to duck every time he or she walks through the apartment and if you forget just once you'll wind up with the same near concussion that I did. Other than that everything was great but I cannot recommend the apartment for tall guests after my experience."
128,1,2014-09-21,"Our stay was amazing! My boyfriend and I said a couple of days on our (email hidden)e apartment was clean, quiet and close to downtown. The outside sitting area was really nice. The kitchen was great. The bed was so so so comfy! We often didn't want to get out! We would recommend this apartment to anyone!"
129,1,2014-09-23,"The reservation was canceled by the host 1 days before arrival. This left us scrambling for a place to stay at the last minute. Not cool! Won't book with this host again."
130,8,2014-09-23,"We just returned from a week long family (adults only) vacation in Seattle. Our trip goal was to spend time with our son who lives in Ballard and our daughter and her 'sig. other' who are from CT. We were able to find the perfect 'home port' for four adults in this lovely old house just a few blocks away from our sons place and all of the local Ballard activity. Once inside this home we knew we had made the right choice. It is top notch. Very well maintained with top of the line finishes and all of the amenities and right in the thick of things. Comfy, comfy, comfy beds. Also, this house was a very quiet space. Perfect. The host was very helpful and always available if we had questions. We were able to see so much of Seattle and the islands (of course we had our own tour guide) and then return to a super comfortable but elegant space to rest up for the next adventure. Seattle is an amazing place and there is so much to see. We did the touristy things first to learn and then local spots for fun. Climbed the mountain, rode the ferries and visited many museums and galleries. Even rode a duck for a great history tour with Capt. Baveliver. Ballard has so much to offer and we found it has the best restaurants in the city. Our last visit was 8 years ago and so much has changed. We really could have stayed another week to see more. So of course we have already started talking about another trip with the grandchildren. Can't wait."
131,1,2014-10-02,"Great little spot, easy to get to downtown via bus. The apartment was neat and tidy with all the basics. The bed was very comfortable! I definitely recommend to anyone."
132,10,2014-10-06,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Perfect size for me, my wife and our 2 kids. The townhouse was very comfortable and the hosts make you feel right at home. The hosts were super responsive to any questions. Fantastic hosts!We couldn't have asked for a better location. An easy 10 minute walk to the heart of downtown Ballard and 5 minutes to all sorts of other amenities, restaurants and cafes. Cafe Besalu has some of the best croissants you have ever tasted. We'll be back!"
133,4,2014-10-09,"Very nice basement apartment, clean with all the amenities. Super close to a park we frequented with our dog. In the early mornings there was always a dog or two out for her to play with. The host also helped us by letting us reserve a couple of extra nights because we were in a bind."
134,1,2014-10-14,"Lots of nice little touches that made us feel at home like throws on the patio sofa & a tea kettle. A super comfy bed and simple but beautiful decor. I also appreciate how much of the work the host has done herself. The apartment is close enough to everything we wanted to see. It was wonderful being so close to a grocery store with the full kitchen to make some of our meals.Overall, a most enjoyable stay."
135,4,2014-10-18,"This was a great place in a perfect location. Very close to all the shops/restaurants/bars in Upper Queen Anne. Would stay here again!"
136,4,2014-10-20,"This apt was a very welcome and clean place. It's walking distance to a little main street area w/ shops and bars and also a very short cab ride (or a ~$5 Uber ride) to the Belltown area where lots of nightlife is. One thing to note is that the sound does carry from the floor above so you may hear some footsteps, especially if sleeping in late. Not a big issue but something to note. Overall I would recommend it."
137,8,2014-10-25,"I had a wonderful stay in this apartment! It's a beautifully remodeled space and it had everything I needed. The host was very communicative and left detailed information about the apartment. Highly recommended."
138,1,2014-10-25,"We really enjoyed our stay. The area was spacious and it was great to have some of the amenities of home! The kitchen and access to laundry were very helpful. It is a couple blocks from a major bus line which made it very easy for is to navigate the city. Everything was very clean and was exactly like the pictures."
139,1,2014-10-26,"This host made me feel very welcome. The apartment was lovely; very comfortable. Lots of privacy. Nice neighborhood. I hope to stay there again."
140,4,2014-10-27,"This apartment in Queen Anne was great. It was in a convenient location near shops and restaurants, and a short cab ride to Capitol Hill. The apartment was clean and spacious enough for 3-4 people. The host was also flexible enough with the check-out, and allowed my friends to leave their luggage in the apartment until their evening flight on check-out day. We really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely book This apartment again. Thank you!"
141,1,2014-10-30,"The place was awesome, even better than the pictures made it look. Really comfortable and had everything you'd need. The host was great and I'd absolutely stay here again."
142,1,2014-10-31,"We stayed just done night at the little apartment under the host's beautiful house in the Seattle hills, but it was lovely. The apt is quite large for just 2 folks and it seems (based on what seemed like a pull-out couch) the place could accommodate 4. There is even your own personal terrace sitting area which alas we couldn't enjoy because it was raining. When we got there, we knocked to say hello to the host and in 5 minutes she gave us a great list of Seattle places to eat, dance, etc. No complaints whatsoever!"
143,1,2014-11-01,"We only stayed at for 1 night, but had a lovely time. The apartment provided more than enough space for the 3 of us, with the bed and pull-out couch. Styling in the apartment made it feel very cozy, and we definitely felt comfortable during our stay. There is free street parking available right in front of the home, which was very valuable to us. We unfortunately did not have the pleasure of meeting the host, who was very responsive and flexible with our check-in time, but we were still able to check in and out with ease.Overall, an enjoyable stay and definitely a place we would recommend."
144,4,2014-11-02,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient. This rental is in a great location. It was a great experience."
146,1,2014-11-04,"The beautiful home up the hill is the more than I thought I'd get, more lovely and updated than the pictures posted. So close to Kerry Park view point, Seattle Center, Ballard Locks, Sculpture Park and only one express bus ride from downtown Seattle.Meija's home was easy to find but, having arrived after dark, it did take us some minutes to locate the gate to the apartment, which blends in so well with the wooden fence. She constantly communicated and updated us with all possible routes to the house.You need more days to enjoy the place; spacious, full of light, peaceful and delight. All the fine things override the famous low beam from which instinct (and forewarning) saved the 6'2.5\ that is me. I met our host once and she was friendly and charming.I'll recommend it to friends, home away from away."
147,4,2014-11-09,"My friend and I had a great experience staying in this home. The location is excellent; close to all the fun but far enough away to relax. Uber rides downtown are very inexpensive!"
148,4,2014-11-10,"Did not have chance to meet the host but was good communication and easy to find and access apartment. Location is great on Queen Anne Hill which is a charming and very walkable location. Amenities of apartment were as described. Did only a one night stay but would easily accommodated lo get stay with kitchen amenities"
149,1,2014-11-14,"Thank you! My parents just thought your apt was wonderful and peaceful. They talked about how comfortable the bed was and how tranquil the space felt:) everything for them was perfect...thank you again from Nestor and myself!"
150,1,2014-11-15,"Completely met all our expectations. Quiet, comfortable and cosy. Street parking was easy. Location is very convenient for Seattle. We will stay again if available when we travel to Seattle."
151,1,2014-11-17,"This little gem is just right, with a great bed, ample kitchen, and a front porch/seating area we can't wait to use when we visit during the summer. Her placement of plants was just the right touch. And it is close to downtown and to Ballard where our daughter now lives. We are so thankful for the host's fast response to our request as our other place cancelled on us last minute. She was so accommodating and her directions were spot on!"
152,4,2014-11-19,"The host had a lovely space and was convienently located to all the major attractions downtown. It was about a 10 minute drive to everything. The home is located in a great neighborhood with a great dog park just around the block (which worked out great for me and my pup!). He had all the comforts of home readily available and the water pressure from the shower was excellent (always a deal breaker for me!). I will def stay at This again and suggest this space for anyone looking for reasonable accomodations close to the city but not caught up in all the hub bub!"
153,4,2014-11-24,"The host was an awesome host! Response times to my initial inquiry and all subsequent communications were fast and efficient. Instructions were clear and everything is exactly as I was expected and pictured. When I say he was awesome it was because he was there if we needed anything and WASN'T there when we didn't. Perfect rental experience. Thanks again!"
154,1,2014-11-24,"We had a great stay. The apartment had everything needed for a comfortable stay and a lovely outdoor space to use in better weather. The host was easy to communicate with and we were glad to find a space to so near some friends with a new baby. We're hoping to come back for more visits!"
155,10,2014-11-30,"The Cute Cozy Townhome in Ballard was also very clean and comfortable... hotel-like. We couldn't have been happier!"
156,1,2014-12-01,"Place was great. The host was great. Can't wait to come back.Everything clean, comfy, cozy, spacious. Fast internet. One heads up: be prepared to juggle some parking."
157,4,2014-12-01,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! So easy to walk to Queen Anne for great coffee shops (Storyline?), restaurants and shops. Trader Joes, Safeway and a great natural health store are a 5 minute walk. Traveling with kids? There's a great park and rec centre less than a block away. Kitchen was a bit sparse but the host was quick to supply us with an extra mug when needed. Has a coffee machine (bring filters) and an assortment of cooking ware (some have seen better days but sufficient). Overall this place could be a bit cleaner (sheets weren't changed when we arrived), but having access to laundry was great! The host and his son went above and beyond in inviting our son to play upstairs in their space and even provided a few toys. It was nice to not worry about our son being too loud and rambunctious:)."
158,8,2014-12-02,"We loved this place. It was very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. The living room was sunny and pleasant. It was perfect for our family of four adults and one child. The place is located on a very pleasant street waling distance to the main shopping area of Ballard. The host was very accommodating and responsive."
159,1,2014-12-07,"This host responded quickly to any questions. I loved how the place looked (better than the pictures in my opinion). The place was so nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. The host's directions to the place were really helpful (GPS can be tricky) and we found it in no time. Street parking was a little tricky, but we managed to always find a spot no more than 5 minutes walking distance. The location itself was great too, with a bus stop right around the corner, and downtown Seattle a short bus ride away. Overall, had a great experience, no problems at all. Would totally come back again :)"
160,1,2014-12-18,"The host's apartment was perfect for our stay. She provided everything that we needed for our time there. It was cozy, well furnished, and felt like home. The apartment is a little more out of the way than we had hoped but it was easy to take lyft, uber, and busses everywhere we needed to go."
161,4,2014-12-26,"I booked This place for my in-laws who were visiting for the holidays, and this was perfect for them. They were very confortable staying here. The host was a great communicator and this apt. is in a great location. They loved the trader joes that was near by. :)"
162,4,2014-12-30,"We really enjoyed staying here! Pros: Location, parking, pet-friendly, cute minimalist yet home-y decor, Apple TV, board games. The host was super nice and responsive. He was also really flexible and kind enough to let us check in early. Cons: Cleanliness was decent but not great. We'd give this 3/5 stars...it needed a good deep cleaning. It was pretty dusty in some places, and the bathroom trash wasn't taken out before we got there. We wondered if this was because we asked to check in early. The neighborhood is really quiet, yet there were two issues with noise. One was that you could hear some running (little kid feet) upstairs. We didn't mind it so much because it wasn't at odd hours or above the bedroom, but I could see how it might bother other guests. The other thing is that the heater is pretty loud in the bedroom, and it did wake us up a couple times.If we could give 3.5 stars, we would. It was somewhere between average and great."
184,1,2015-03-04,"A night's stay in this apartment was perfect! It is minutes away from downtown, but still a great price. Everything was clean, and the bed was very comfortable!"
185,1,2015-03-07,"The host was very helpful in communication before and throughout our stay. She was warm in her tone even when there was a leak of water. The description of the listing was accurate, The atmosphere and setting were great!"
163,1,2014-12-31,"We very much enjoyed our stay here. We were here over the Christmas holiday week and the host was away so we didn't meet her in person but she stayed in touch and made sure we knew where to reach her in case of a problem. The space is roomier than we thought it would be. We enjoyed having our own kitchen and dining table and the living room couch made a very comfortable bed for our son on the nights he visited.We appreciated that we were able to walk to Whole Foods (less than 1/2 mile away) and our daughters home in Queen Anne neighborhood.( be aware that this walk required a fair amount of stairs uphill.)We will definitely consider staying here again next time we visit Seattle. The outdoor seating area looked quite pleasant though we weren't able to enjoy it in December. Overall, the place felt like home away from home."
164,1,2015-01-03,"Loved our stay at the Apt. Close to everything we wanted to see and do. So much better than a hotel! Felt like we had a great \home base\. Love the live plants. Again, thanks!"
165,3,2015-01-04,"Staying here was great! The hallway leading into the apartment is old and may mislead you into thinking that the apartment is equally as unkempt, but don't be fooled! The interior is beautiful, and you can tell the host put a lot of thought into decorating the space. Definitely recommend!!!"
166,4,2015-01-07,"The place was comfortable, in a great place, and has a great host. It was easy to walk to places to get coffee in the mornings and there was plenty of street parking in case you end up renting a car. There was nothing at all to complain about during the stay!"
167,1,2015-01-09,"The apartment was lovely. Everything was clean, well-kept, and the bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood was very nice, although it was a mile uphill walk to the nearest market. The only drawback was that the walls were pretty thin, so I could hear everyone upstairs and outside."
168,1,2015-01-14,"We had an absolutely amazing Seattle experience and the primary reason was the excellent conditions that we stayed in. The host provided my group with everything we required and was very helpful and prompt with any enquiries that we had regarding travel around Seattle. Located just across the road from a RapidRide bus which took us directly into the heart of downtown, this abode is perfect for those who want to be close to the city without being right in the thick of it. The establishment itself was impeccable and we had all we needed at our disposal. Highly recommended and my wife and I will definitely be staying there when we return to Seattle!"
169,4,2015-01-14,"The host is an amazing host. He is so easy to communicate with and is very accommodating. The home is perfect with everything you need. The location is great with grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, and public transportation just steps away. I will definitely being staying here anytime I'm in Seattle!"
170,1,2015-01-18,"Everything stated and presented was accurate. I so enjoyed my stay. The first night, I had a few friends over for dinner. Everything I needed was there to do so, and the host warmly supported me in my choice to have guests upon my arrival. This is my first visit to Seattle without a rent car. Although the street a little tricky if I used a cab, the bus route was very convenient from this location. I also took the light rail from airport, and it was all a breeze. I feel my stay here was the perfect choice. I hope it will be available when I again visit."
171,4,2015-01-23,"The host is a very hospitable and gracious host. He is very friendly and helpful. His communications, both in person and via text, were very helpful and made for a delightful stay. His apartment is located in a convenient spot on Queen Anne close to bus routes, excellent restaurants, grocery stores, shops and fun boutiques. The apartment is very clean and well maintained with all of amenities of home--a very comfortable place to stay if you're visiting Seattle.I was at his apartment the day of the 2015 Seahawks breathtaking win of the NFC Championship. He invited me to his home to watch the game on his 105\ screen home theater with his 3 year old son. What a treat that was! It was a very memorable Seattle experience. Thanks! I look forward to coming back."
172,4,2015-01-26,"The host was very accommodating and welcoming. My husband ad I stayed 3 nights while visiting our daughter and family who just recently moved to Queen Anne. Comfortable bed ad nice warm shower. Very close to Quee Anne Avenue shops and restaurants. Information provided was accurate and helpful."
173,4,2015-01-31,"This is a great place up on Queen Anne hill. Very quiet yet near plenty of grocery stores an cafes. The host clearly put some time and resources into renovating the apartment. The bathroom and kitchen were particularly nice, and we spent a lot of time cooking food there. We were two people looking for two beds in separate rooms, and this was a great arrangement for the price. The pullout couch in the living room was quite comfortable. One of our favorite perks was the free access to the washer and dryer. So nice when you're in town for a while, or just coming in from the rain."
174,10,2015-02-01,"Adorable space in an ideal location to explore downtown Ballard. Great hosts, they checked in on us and were very responsive with questions. Highly recommended!"

177,1,2015-02-17,"The host's space was lovely and very cozy. Although we didn't end up meeting in person, she was very responsive and accommodating. We had everything we needed for our quick trip to Seattle. The location was easily accessible to major bus lines and popular neighborhoods and felt private and secure. I would definitely stay here again!"
178,1,2015-02-18,"I loved this place. Cute mid-century modern decor, very clean, comfortable bed. The host was easy to communicate with and very prompt and helpful. I especially appreciated that she allowed me to book very last minute. Another bonus was the home's lovely gardens and the flower petal-lined steps leading down to the apartment. I'll definitely check to see if her place is available the next time I'm in Seattle."
179,1,2015-02-19,"The host's home was wonderful and perfect for my needs. Even though I was unexpectedly in Seattle and booking late she contacted me promptly and greeted me warmly."
180,1,2015-02-23,"Great stay, the home was very cute and cozy."
181,1,2015-02-26,"The host was quick to respond to my request and we found her apartment as advertised. Cute little place, good price, no complaints!"
182,1,2015-02-27,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at this apartment. We loved the way it was decorated inside, from the plants to furniture. The bed was super comfortable and the surrounding gardening was perfect. The host have great directions for an easy check in and was quick to respond to questions. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to come back."
342,1,2015-12-07,"It was a wonderful stay! Beautiful, clean apartment. A bit tricky to find on a dark, rainy night. Also a little hard to find parking. Would stay again!"
186,4,2015-03-09,"We enjoyed staying here for 3 weeks with our little dog. The host was very kind and accommodating to us. The place was very clean and cozy. We really liked how comfortable our bed was! The Apple TV (with HBO Go) was really nice to have as well. It was great to have within walking distance, a park (one block away), Trader Joe's, and Storyville Coffee. We would stay here again!"
187,1,2015-03-10,"Great spot and a good value. Easy parking and access to a main road that will get you downtown quickly. Would definitely stay here again."
188,1,2015-03-11,"Great communication!! The host did a wonderful job of getting me all the info I needed to ensure a pleasant, trouble-free stay."
189,1,2015-03-15,"The home was cozy - it had a bed, pull-out couch, full kitchen, dining table, and a clean bathroom. The space does have low ceilings (maybe 6.5'?), but there is a beam in the middle that my husband almost hit his head on (he's 5'11\). Other than that, everything was clean and in working order. The garden area is beautiful and there is a nice view. You can hear traffic a bit, but only if the doors/windows are open. I did not actually meet the host, but my husband and I were running around a lot so I'm not surprised. The neighborhood was nice, very residential area. It didn't seem like there was a whole lot within walking distance (a couple of restaurants and an Irish pub), but it was very close to public transit which was able to take us everywhere we needed to go."
190,1,2015-03-17,"We stayed here for a quick overnight stop in Seattle on our way up the coast. The space is so adorable. I wanted her to come decorate our own house. We loved it. The bed was insanely comfy. It was a little difficult to find street parking at night but during the day was fine. I have no complaints, everything was easy and comfortable. Thanks!!"
191,1,2015-03-22,"The host gave me all the info i needed to find her place..the apartment was lovely,spacious and felt very welcoming!She was available via text if there was an issue.She made a point to check in with me and making sure I was fine.I loved the Queen Anne area and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings."
192,4,2015-03-24,"My parents stayed in this apartment when they were here visiting from out of town. The place was great! Clean, neat and super functional. It's a cozy little apartment in a great location. My parents couldn't have been happier!"
193,4,2015-03-27,"The listing is pretty much on par to the description, and the pictures tell it all. Our stay was very comfortable, everything was very clean, grabbing the keys was the easiest we ran into on our road trip of a few other cities. The space was also very private, we didn't run into the host at all, although we knew he was upstairs (think of apt living when someone is above you). Nothing too crazy, pretty quiet for the most part during our stay except for one night, but it's understandable. Instruction booklet is clear and bathroom was really nice and clean. The location was great too. I would consider staying here again in the future."
194,4,2015-03-30,"Great place to stay in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood. Loved the shops and restaurants within walking distance! The place is very clean and well decorated. Thanks!"
195,4,2015-04-03,"Great location. The host was super helpful and accommodating. A cold beer in the fridge, comfortable bed and clean place. I'd definitely stay there again!"
196,1,2015-04-05,"My partner and I had a wonderful experience here. Her patio was inviting and quaint with flowers, and foliage everywhere-- definitely a place I would want to relax! The apartment was stocked with the essentials (hair dryer, towels, curling iron, extra pillows, etc). The bed was very comfortable, and we had everything we needed for our 4 day stay. We didn't realize until the last day that no one was home in the main house above us, when we spoke to the host for the first time. She was a very friendly and open person, and it was apparent she cared about her guests' comfort. We would definitely stay here again."
197,10,2015-04-05,"The host was very responsive to our initial booking request and all the follow-up questions we had. We coordinated our arrival easily and their home is a lovely town home in Ballard. We enjoyed the upstairs bedrooms w/ a jointly shared bath, making traveling with one of our parents easy and more cozy than two hotel rooms. The main floor with a living room and kitchen was nice to relax in during the evenings. Very clean and decorated nicely. We would enjoy a stay again!"
198,4,2015-04-06,"This home has tons of amenities and he has put care into making it easy to navigate the home and the neighborhood. We appreciated the binder with information, felt comfortable in the home and found it perfect for two of us!"
199,1,2015-04-06,"Beautiful space. Perfect for the two of us. We'll be coming back!"
200,4,2015-04-08,"This is the quietest rental I have ever stayed at. Great location with a memory foam bed and pull out second bed. My daughter and I used it as our base to explore UW and all of Seattle. It fit the job perfectly and would come back here again."
201,4,2015-04-10,"The apartment was exactly as described. Queen Anne is a great neighborhood and we felt completely at home there. It is close to downtown and is walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants. The host was very quick to respond. We would definitely stay there again!"
202,4,2015-04-12,"My friend and I spent a couple of days at this place. It's in a good location, short drive to downtown and close to restaurants and grocery stores. The place itself, the beds, the pillows are very comfortable but the suite was not very clean. We brought this up with the host, he replied right away and sent his cleaner the next day. Even though he said the cleaner had cleaned the place the morning we arrived. Unfortunately the cleaner didn't do a good job. Other than day, the sheets and towels were clean and the host was very quick to respond to my emails and apologized for the inconvenience."
203,1,2015-04-14,"The host is a welcoming and friendly. The apartment is in a nice quiet neighborhood and we were comfortable walking around it. We were so pleased that it was only a few blocks from our daughters so we could easily visit her without driving from a hotel. The apartment is roomy, clean, and well supplied.The cost is very reasonable. We enjoyed staying there and hope to again. Thanks for sharing the apartment with us!"
204,6,2015-04-18,"Great location and super great host."
205,4,2015-04-19,"Hospitality was great! He checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. He had beers in the fridge and a cross-referenced map of restaurants, cafes and stores with descriptions & recommendations. The neighborhood was beautiful and quaint and the \garden\ unit was only two blocks from Queen Anne Ave. The unit, while having somewhat low ceilings, was bright, clean and stylish. It was stocked with cooking utensils, coffee and coffee maker, toaster oven, blender, etc. Also, lots of clean towels and extra bedding. The bed was pretty comfortable, too! The TV had clear instructions, with tons of subscriptions on AppleTV and also a DVD player available for use. There was also a dedicated parking spot that went along with the unit. It was just what we needed for our stay. :)"
206,10,2015-04-19,"We had a great experience at this townhome. The host left us a welcome gift of local artisan popcorn and a bottle of wine... who doesn't love that! The townhome is conveniently located so we were able to walk to all the restaurants, shops, and farmers market in Ballard. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle!"
207,4,2015-04-21,"This place is just fantastic. Clean, quiet, lovely, and incredibly convenient -- I never had any issues getting anywhere around town. The host was quick to reach out to see if I needed anything, and quick to respond when I had questions about the neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
208,8,2015-04-25,"We really enjoyed our time at this yellow house! Our upstairs apartment was so beautiful, spacious, and comfy. The whole place was impeccably maintained and furnished beautifully. The renovation was smartly planned out too. I wished we could live there! The host gave us a tour of the downstairs apartment too! The downstairs was gorgeous with vaulted ceilings and a chef's kitchen. This is an easy place to call home! And the host was such a great communicator and warm host. We'll try to visit again!"
209,1,2015-04-27,"This spacious apartment was perfect for us as our daughter lives right next door. The apartment was clean, comfortable and homey and was just like the description. We loved sitting on the deck, having a full kitchen(everything we needed) and use of a washer/dryer as we stayed for 9 days. The host was welcoming and warm. Street parking was easy and easy access to downtown.We would surely stay here again.Ron and Joanne"
210,4,2015-04-29,"This place was perfect! Great location to walk or uber to all you want to see and walking the neighbor hood is a treat! Cozy place with everything you need! Comfy bed, hot shower and all the supplies you need! We were able to cook fresh fish from Pikes and had everything we needed :) I would recommend this to anyone who plans to stay in Seattle!"
211,1,2015-05-01,"The host was a warm, welcoming person. She greeted us, gave us the key and said if we needed anything we could send her a text. Her home is gorgeous and peaceful. There were 4 of us staying and we all had a wonderful time. The beds were super comfortable, the place was kept very clean and everything we needed was available to us. Fridge/stove/microwave, washer/dryer, dishes/silverware, central heating/cooling & wifi. It was really, SO nice. I highly recommend this place!"
212,4,2015-05-03,"Loved this place! Location was very good, get a great view of the Seattle skyline only a couple blocks away. Apartment is very well equipped and the host left a detailed notebook with all the information you need for a visit, whether for a couple days or a week."
213,8,2015-05-03,"Our stay at this renovated two bedroom in Ballard couldn't have been better. The rooms were tastefully furnished, the bathroom and kitchens were modern and complete, and the rooms were stocked with everything you could possibly need for an extended stay. The skylights and windows flooded the whole place with natural light even during rainy days. Best of all, the house was an easy walk from Ballard's great restaurants and farmer's market. We will definitely find an excuse to stay there again soon."
214,4,2015-05-06,"We had a great experience during our time in Seattle. The host was responsive to our email questions, and made us feel welcome. The description and photos were spot on. The neighborhood is wonderful, and as described... a walker's dream. Good coffee and food were a walk away. We would definitely recommend This place to friends, and look forward to returning."
215,1,2015-05-08,"Beautiful, peaceful apartment with absolutely everything we needed. Gorgeous scenery absolutely everywhere. Thank you for being so quick to respond and so helpful. Our trip to Seattle was so perfect and public transportation was amazing (and so close to the apartment!)"
216,1,2015-05-14,"The apartment is lovely and feels really secluded, but with good bus links v close by. The host was very accommodating. Would definitely recommend!"
217,4,2015-05-19,"Awesome spot, easy parking, walking distance to great places to eat in Queen Anne as well!"
218,1,2015-05-22,"Staying in this tucked away accommodation for two days was a wonderful experience. The space was clean, well-designed and oriented, and was easy to access from public transportation. The host was very helpful with checking in before the stay and gave me detailed logistical information so that I would not face any issues. I would definitely recommend this accommodation for anyone looking for a relaxing, comfortable stay."
219,4,2015-05-24,"The host is very welcoming and professional. The unit is just as described, even better! Everything works well, particularly the kitchen and sleeping areas. The interior colors are calming. The TV and video equipment are great. I think everything was just right! And, the neighborhood is super with a Trader Joe's and Safeway nearby. If you are on foot, the number 13 bus takes you right into town. Thank you!"
220,6,2015-05-25,"The description was accurate - the suite is very similar to a hotel room, but was the perfect size for our visit.The location worked well, but it would have been nice to be a little closer to coffee shops and amenities. The building is very quiet and relaxed."
221,1,2015-05-25,"We had to make a last minute change to our dates and the host was very flexible. She provided recommendations for various activities that we were interested in. The apartment is a bit difficult to find, but this host gave us fair warning and helpful directions. We loved the Queen Anne neighborhood where the apartment is located. It was tranquil and central to most of the places that we wanted to visit. Parking was easy to find as well."
222,10,2015-05-25,"The host was very easy to work with and we really enjoyed this awesome location in Ballard. We would definitely stay again and have already recommended this home to our friends."
223,1,2015-05-27,"Great area. A bit difficult to find, but very nice."
224,1,2015-06-01,"Lovely place at a super affordable price! Great communication with host. We loved the outside garden and back patio especially!"
225,4,2015-06-04,"On the plus side: The place is very much as described, and it was clean, and is in a great location for both neighborhood activities and access to downtown and other areas of Seattle. The host also has a ton of movies available to stream on the TV.On the negative side: Though it does technically qualify as an \entire home/apt\ unit - given that it does not share access or any rooms with the main house - it does get a lot of noise from the main house above, especially the child running around on what I assume are hardwood floors. So it doesn't always feel quiet or private. The host hosted an afternoon party at the house one day while we were there (he gave us a few hours' notice and did offer us an invitation) and the noise was significant, though he did get the TV turned down when I requested it.In all, it is a good place, but it may feel like a shared space when you stay here just because the sound carries."
226,1,2015-06-04,"We stayed in this apartment for 3 nights. It was a perfect place to start our holiday in North West USA! The apartment was cosy, clean and comfortable."

230,4,2015-06-13,"Convenient location in great neighborhood and the host provides a wealth of information."
231,6,2015-06-14,"The host makes you feel very welcome. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. Perfect location for my visit to Seattle."
232,1,2015-06-15,"This space was perfect for our stay in Seattle! The host met us at the house and was very nice. Everything was ready for us, even though we were early. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. We were about a mile from SPU and getting to the Key Arena and downtown Seattle was a snap! Parking was never a problem and we always parked close by. We got really good at parallel parking. The available washer and dryer was a bonus. We will be back again."
233,1,2015-06-16,"We just spent 1 night here, and it met our needs. We liked the decor, and the garden path we walked through to get to the apt."
234,1,2015-06-17,"The host - was very attentive and helped be flexible to accommodate our late check-in to Seattle. The apartment was very well located and had everything we needed. We only stayed one quick night but there are no complaints. Street parking is a little strange because the street is very narrow and cars park/drive in both directions but we didn't have a problem finding a spot. The host, did a great job in providing clean towels, sheets, and kitchen supplies."
235,4,2015-06-20,"This apartment is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! You will be close to an adorable downtown area of Queen Anne as well as public transit. The apartment is plenty spacious for a couple or small family. Additionally, it's great if you want to stay in or go out. The host was more than gracious in supporting any of our needs."
236,1,2015-06-22,"The apartment was (email hidden)fortable with plenty of space for the three of us. The host was in touch with us before and during our stay, providing directions, welcoming us and with an invitation for assistance if we needed it. A gracious hostess. Would certainly recommend that others check out this listing and will stay here again when back in the area."
237,1,2015-06-27,"The apartment was exactly as described. It was private, had lots of open space, and a lovely deck to sit outside. The bed was amazing and once you put your feet up and laid back, you are asleep! Plenty of room for my cousin and I to spread out and watch T.V. or read or write. The guestbook is a nice touch to see who else has stayed there and the nice comments they had for the host."
238,6,2015-06-28,"This airy studio had all the amenities and the most amazing view from the spacious patio. Walking distance to downtown and offering killer views this property was more than I could have hoped for. Our hostess was more than helpful and left everything a visitor could need, whether staying for one night or more. I cannot recommend this property highly enough!"
239,4,2015-06-30,"Incredible neighborhood: beautiful homes and gardens on every street, just a few blocks from some great cafes and restaurants. Really accessible to downtown. Apartment was comfortable for a group of four sharing one main bed and one pullout. Clean and comfortable. The host was very accommodating, including shipping back a bag we left behind promptly and courteously! Thanks for our first great stay in Seattle!!"
240,1,2015-07-04,"Staying here was a seamless experience. Thanks!"
241,1,2015-07-05,"This place is beautiful, exactly what described in a very peaceful zone with lots of nature around it. We really enjoyed our time there"
242,10,2015-07-10,"Second leg of a trip to Vancouver and Seattle. Stayed for two nights. The host made everything really convenient! Although I never met her in person (we tried to but we got there late and something came up on her end), there was awesome communication and we were able to get in with no problem. The wife and my mom loved the place! So cute and quaint! Instruments available to play and books on shelves and in cabinets. Wife also loved the selection of amenities and how the rooms were decorated! Happy wife happy life right?! 2 queen bed were comfortable and neighborhood had a really great vibe. Awesome restaurants and bars right around the corner stretching for blocks! It also wasn't as noisy as I thought it might have been at night. Very quiet except for small pockets of people walking by and chatting. Reminds me of Brighton/Allston area in Boston.Seattle is a very cool and hip and it's reflected that while staying here! Awesome experience and would recommend the next person."
243,4,2015-07-10,"We appreciated the host being upfront with us. When his construction team became available during our stay and there would be noise, he let us know and allowed us to cancel our reservation."
244,1,2015-07-10,"Great place! So spacious and beautifully furnished! The place is so breezy and comfortable! And AC- what a treat!"
245,6,2015-07-12,"This is a great location just a few minutes' walk from Queen Anne and Key Arena. There is free parking. The apartment is a studio, so it's small, but it is set up beautifully and it is clean and comfortable. The host was great about communicating with us to give us information and helpful directions to the place."
246,10,2015-07-13,"We had a wonderful time staying here. It's very comfortable and has everything you need to make the stay enjoyable. The location is awesome, so close to everything in Ballard and not far from downtown. Garage parking was a definite plus.Communication was easy and everything went very smoothly. We highly recommend staying here!"
247,4,2015-07-13,"This place is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood very close to some amazing coffee, restaurants, and shops. We appreciated being an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and downtown (an easy walk there... the return walk is straight uphill, just a warning! :) This house had some unexpected construction going on at the time, and he was extremely accommodating and apologetic about the inconvenience, offering us a partial refund for our stay. The place itself was very basic and comfortable, nothing fancy, but it worked for us for the weekend."
248,1,2015-07-16,"Cute little place in a perfect location for getting around Seattle. Had plenty of room and everything we needed for a long stay."
249,3,2015-07-18,"We had a lovely stay here. The host left us some recommendentations on things to do and places to go.We used the local bus alot to get around, as we did not have a car, which was very easy. The host had also been very clear about renovations in her building so we knew what to expect during our stay."
250,6,2015-07-19,"Great place! Clean, comfortable bed. Great location!"
251,10,2015-07-20,"They were absolutely wonderful hosts! Their townhome has a very homey feel and is in such a great location. While staying there, our group was able to walk into Ballard, or take a quick drive to Fremont, Capitol Hill and Queen Anne. I look forward to staying in this townhome again!"
252,3,2015-07-21,"Arrived to find an apartment on the lower west side of Queen Anne with views of Interbay (15th ave. west), the train tracks, and Magnolia hill.. The building is undergoing what I would call a major, not a minor, renovation at this time. Apartment is west-facing, so we found the space stuffy to be quite honest. Also, the construction, being loud with hammering and nail guns starting at 7:30 am forced us to leave for one full day of our stay between the hours of 7:30-4:30."
253,10,2015-07-22,"This townhouse was the best! My husband and dad stayed here during a short 2 night visit to Seattle but I could've seen myself living in this gem. The house was beautifully decorated and everything was clean and well organized. The floor plan and layout of the place maximized space and efficiency. The hosts were great hosts and easy to communicate with. They met us at the house and gave us a tour before leaving us to our privacy. There was a private garage to house our car, which was super convenient. The house is located only a few blocks from the Ballard neighborhood, which had tons of great restaurants, bars, and shops. We absolutely loved staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone."
254,1,2015-07-23,"Wonderful hostess. Very helpful and attentive."
255,4,2015-07-25,"The fact that the host is upstairs is great...he is very quick at responding to any needs. The neighborhood is (email hidden)pecially with kids...there is a great park...at the end of the alley..which was really fun. Everything was just like it had been explained...we loved the place and the (email hidden)ank you..it met our needs."
256,3,2015-07-25,"The host's condo is in a great area, and is clean and comfortable. The sofa is large and comfortable for sleeping an extra person."
257,6,2015-07-27,"The apt is adorable! It's clean and cozy. Perfect stay if you plan on just sleeping there. Checking in and out was a breeze. Looking forward to visiting again!"
258,10,2015-07-29,"Condo was super clean and beautiful. My dad and I did a father daughter trip, and this was so perfect for us given the 2 bedrooms, kitchen, living room, etc. Blankets, towels, pots / pans, etc. were all really good quality, and honestly just made you feel like home away from home. It made you feel like you were staying at a really good friend's house (who's clean / neat / has nice stuff) and who completely trusted you with their place. We had a car so location wasn't a problem at all. It was also great that there's a market across the street, a gas station right next door, and an AMAZING biscuit / breakfast sandwich shop the next street over. All in all, this rental was awesome and worth every penny. Host was super responsive in communication and helpful. My dad and I was supposed to head up to Vancouver but I forgot my passport and was delayed a night in Seattle while I waited for my passport to be shipped over. I had to book an additional night last minute, which the host was accommodating. They immediately noticed that I was overpaying for fees since I had to book another separate night and had refunded me the amount - all without me asking for it! Honestly, 5 stars for such honesty; I truly felt so comfortable staying here and would highly recommend it."
259,1,2015-07-30,"Very nicely decorated and laid out. Comfortable, gardeny feeling to the whole place. Great location for getting around Seattle. We had a problem with a door closure, which was fixed very quickly and efficiently. As advertised, it is pretty easy to hear the upstairs neighbors, so if you are very sensitive to noise, that might be an issue for you. Otherwise - I strongly recommend this place and the host."
260,6,2015-08-01,"The host made us feel super welcome and was great at communicating! The place was just as described, perfect for one or two people for a short stay, and in a great location! ESPECIALLY perfect for heading over to the port for cruises early in the morning - it was a 10 minute ride! Also walking distance to the space needle. We loved our stay here!"
261,1,2015-08-02,"We had a lovely stay. The apartment is cute, clean and private. It was a nice oasis in the city and an easy place to hang out. We came with our 3 yr old and she enjoyed it too. We didn't get to meet the host, but she was available to answer questions and help us find it. We would stay here again."
262,10,2015-08-03,"The town home was very comfortable and the hosts left us a lovely welcoming note and some goodies. The house is filled with a wide variety of books, a piano and guitar, a well-equipped kitchen, and a nice layout for our small family. The neighborhood is only a two-minute walk from the \main street\ of Ballard with lots to do - restaurants, stores, parks, etc. It is also near the main bus line into town. It felt very safe. We were there during an unusual heat spell, and there was no air conditioning, but there are balconies on both floors and good cross ventilation and fans."
263,4,2015-08-03,"I stayed one week with my wife and our 2 years old kid. The location in Queen Anne is perfect as it is a very nice neighbourhood and close to downtown. When needed, the host was very responsive and helpfull.There is not so much light in the apartment but as we visited Seattle and its surrounding during the day, it was not a problem.Conclusion: I would recommend staying here!"
264,10,2015-08-07,"They left us a friendly note with their contact information, if we needed them. They also left us some treats and a refrigerator that contained many basic items. The house was nicely decorated. The D bus was a few blocks away and takes you downtown to Pike's Market. There are 2 supermarkets within a short walk. There is also a nice Italian restaurant about 2 blocks away on 15th. We would recommend this accommodation and stay there again."
265,6,2015-08-09,"The location was amazing - beautiful views and an easy walk to so many restaurants and attractions.The place is great as well. The host really did a fantastic job of keeping the area spacious and light. The host was very accommodating and caring, and made us feel at home."
266,4,2015-08-10,"The place was awesome, and exactly as described. The host has made the place feel very welcoming and a great home away from home. The location is in a good spot close to many things and a perfect Uber pickup spot. Would recommend to friends and would stay here again."
267,4,2015-08-12,"I was very happy with our stay. He was very easy to communicate with, the apartment was clean, the location is great, and the bed was the most comfortable one we had slept on since the beginning of our road trip. You can at times hear him upstairs, but I am a light sleeper and didn't have any problems with noise. I would definitely stay there again if we come back to Seattle!"
268,1,2015-08-13,"The good: Good location, comfortable space, comfortable bed, washer and dryerThe bad: It smelled musty (it's an exposed basement), street noise is loud, there were many cobwebs, the only bar soap was soap used by previous tenants (I did bring our own just in case), very few towels, found bathroom floor mats in laundry room which seemed clean, found coffee maker in laundry room (after we bought one)."
269,1,2015-08-15,"The host was very helpful. She met us late at night when we arrived and showed us to the apartment. Thanks for a lovely visit!"
270,4,2015-08-17,"Nice place, close to transport and supermarket. Great place to stay for a small party."
271,4,2015-08-21,"This place was great. The neighborhood was beautiful and very close to several places to eat. Getting to downtown was very easy and public transportation made it easy to move around the city. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable, quiet place to stay while visiting Seattle."
272,5,2015-08-22,"Thank you for the last minute help! My friends had an excellent stay and LOVE your location in the hart of Queen Anne."
273,6,2015-08-23,"We had an amazing time visiting Seattle for the weekend and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. This adorable studio apartment was small but so well organized we never felt cramped. The Amazing use of space. The building itself was beautiful and felt so comfortable to come home to.The apartment has a bus stop across the street which easily takes you downtown. And while you wait you get an amazing view of the Space Needle! It's breathtaking. Or you can walk around the Queen Anne area which is full of adorable shops, cute cafes and amazing restaurants. There's something for everyone. In summary, great space, very welcoming host and we would definitely recommend it!!"
274,4,2015-08-23,"House is in a great location and parking was an awesome feature. Perfect for two old college friends to set off and explore Seattle. We didn't spend much time in the unit, but we found everything to be fine for the price. We didn't interact with the host due to our schedule and the independent nature of the place, but it was clear he and his family were about and was nice to know people were around if we had any urgent questions or issues. Also, a super-comfortable bed!"
275,5,2015-08-23,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying with in Queen Anne in Seattle. The bedroom, bathroom, and lounge area were all very comfortable and clean, and the location was excellent! Queen Anne is a quaint, quieter neighborhood that is still extremely accessible to downtown Seattle. I would highly recommend staying here and would certainly stay here again myself!"
276,1,2015-08-24,"Our hostess was very pleasant and was responsive to some problems that we encountered. The apt is fairly spacious with a nice sized kitchen/dining/living area and a good sized patio with grill and comfortable L shaped lounge area furniture. We, however, had a less than satisfactory time. Our major problem was the plumbing: the one toilet backed up 4 times...no unusual use. The bathroom sink also ran so slowly that we had to wait in between uses. By the 4th back up in the toilet, we contacted the owner who did respond and fix it, but it seems like an ongoing problem. My other disappointment was in the general condition of the place: bed quilt (smelly), grout on bathroom floor dirty. Generally dinginess. The photos make the place look lighter/cleaner than it looks in person. Finally, there are people who live upstairs and there is a lot of foot noise from them dancing (?), jumping (?), running (?) even at night as well as constant noise from a main traffic artery just below this property."
277,9,2015-08-25,"Host family is lovely, prompt communication, easy access instruction.The place is fairly new, adequate but has a really strong cat pee odor.We bought a bag of room fresher, odor eliminator, febreeze etc, had all window and the door open with a fan working 24/7 in the living room, still the smell was very very bad. There is no way the host is not aware of this, it is THAT strong. It needs to be addressed professionally, otherwise it becomes a deal breaker. Also, the large TV is not hooked up to cable, so it functions as a DVD screen. The actual DVD player had no remote, so it took quite some time and the help of our gracious host to make it work."
278,4,2015-08-27,"The host was fantastic! His place was perfect. It's a couple blocks from a small quaint strip of restaurants and grocery stores (There was a Pizza Place that was amazing!...Our favorite food we had on our entire trip.)The unit is convenient and had everything. The host was really quick to help out if we asked but also great about making us feel like we owned to place so we could feel at home after a day exploring Seattle."
279,6,2015-08-30,"This place was decent and just as described. As stated, it's small but has everything you need for a short stay. My only complaint is that the apartment gets pretty warm, with no air conditioning."
280,5,2015-08-31,"The host did an excellent job of communicating before and during our stay (and gave some great suggestions for our time in Seattle). The space was a very comfortable, and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood walking distance (1-2 miles) from the downtown area. It should be noted that this seemed to be a very residential area, so it seemed like you would be headed elsewhere for restaurants, bars, sites, and/or nightlife. Washer/Dryer access was a nice touch after a week on the road."
281,8,2015-08-31,"Our family of 5 had a great time in Seattle. The apartment is spacious, clean and very well equipped. Location is great, with public transport, shops and restaurants all close by. Hosts were great hosts. Always on hand to help. Thank you both very much for a wonderful stay."
282,6,2015-08-31,"Cute hotel style studio with everything you need for your stay. Love the historical feel of the place! Host was very accommodating and check-in was a breeze. Steps away from the bus stop and a short walk to the Seattle center. Overall a good experience!"
283,6,2015-09-01,"Excellent stay! Lovely view and nice clean porch. Very accommodating and easy to stay in touch with."
284,4,2015-09-01,"It was nice stay at this place. It's a quaint and quiet neighborhood filled with shops and a 24-hour Safeway that saved the day many times.The apartment looked just like the pictures. It was great to have access to the washer + dryer, along with the broom and vacuum. I really loved the heater in the bathroom. After taking a shower, I just stood under there. If you stay here, you'll probably do the same thing. lolWe didn't use public transportation to get around because we relied on Uber. If one chooses to use the bus, I think it's the 2 line that gets you into downtown.If you have any issues, the host is quick to respond. We didn't have time to meet him but I'm sure he's nice."
285,1,2015-09-02,"Enjoyable stay, with everything you need to be comfortable away from home. The apartment itself is a little difficult to find (we arrived on a rainy night, which made it even harder), but it is in a very convenient location. Close to public transit and a cheap cab fare to get downtown. We were grateful for all of the kitchen supplies and were able to cook dinner one night with all of the provided utensils and cookware. The kitchen/ dining area is large and there is a full size refrigerator and stove/ oven. It was very rainy in Seattle during our stay, so the provided umbrellas and dehumidifier were great additions as well."
286,4,2015-09-04,"We really enjoyed our stay. This apartment was as described and pictured, it was the right amount of space for us and our 1.5 yr old. Being walking distance to restaurants, coffee shop and grocery stores was awesome and we appreciated not having to drive for every meal. It's also a great location, ~10 mins drive time to most of Seattle's tourist attractions. Highly recommended!"
287,1,2015-09-05,"The host was a great host. The apartment is secluded and has a very relaxing lounge area on the patio. All our meals were cooked in the fully stocked kitchen. My friend and I stayed three nights and did not want to leave. Thank you!"
288,4,2015-09-06,"Though we didn't get a chance to meet the host in person, he made the stay as smooth and comfortable as possible. He checked in to make sure we were settled in and there was a great printed guide in the house. Everything was pretty much as described and it was generally a wonderful stay. Both the bed and sofa bed were extremely comfy and we slept well. Only thing that dampened the experience a bit was that there was a mild musty odor when we first arrived..not a huge deal but it was noticeable. Also, though it is definitely possible to walk to areas from this location, we preferred to have a car..it made things a lot easier to navigate around."
289,5,2015-09-08,"Such a great house in a wonderful neighborhood! The location: Close to everything touristy, but still in the quiet of a residential neighborhood. My husband and I didn't have a car and we either walked or took a really cheap Uber ride to the science center, EMP Museum, space needle, Pike Place Market, and pier (boat tour, aquarium, Ferris wheel). There are also great places to eat that are all very close (5 minute walk), like The 5 Spot and Queen Anne Cafe. The space: So much room and windows for a basement! If I had been blindfolded and placed in this space, I wouldn't even know it was a basement. One thing left out of the pictures is the full bathroom and it is very nice. Well lit, plenty of towels, huge shower, and a variety of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash to choose from. The bedroom and bathroom also have their own temperature controls for heating. It was a little chilly at night so this was an exceptional feature. We didn't use the washer or dryer because we were only there for the weekend. The bed was comfortable and we slept very well. Although we didn't use it much, the TV and couch in the main room were a great amenities. The couch was roomy and relaxing and the TV was huge! It was overall, very clean and very quiet for being a basement. All you can hear is the occasional footsteps from above.The host: As it says on the page, the host really was flexible with check-in/out times, and I appreciated that. Instructions were clear. I didn't meet the host in person, but she was good in communicating via messaging. The only thing I had to ask for was an iron and ironing board which her son was very helpful in getting for us."
290,4,2015-09-08,"This place is in the cutest neighborhood and the home itself is quaint and very nice. We didn't have the chance to meet the host in person but he was quick to respond from the day of booking. If you're looking to spend some time in Seattle without the hustle and bustle of city life, this listing is definitely recommended!"
291,4,2015-09-11,"I'll start with the good: the atmosphere was really nice. People were friendly and welcoming, and there was a genuine feeling of community amongst the residents. Now for the bad: First of all I must state that it seems I stayed at the place when lots of renovation was happening. I'm hoping this is not the norm, so your mileage may vary...I was in a 2 person room on the bottom floor. The shower was being renovated (thus non-existing), so the closest shower was one floor up, shared by the residents of both floors. The renovations were not stated in the listing. My room was adjacent to the work, thus it was impossible to sleep in, since noisy construction started early in the morning. The construction noise also meant that most people preferred to leave the house in order to get some work done. In the room there was an exposed water pipe, and very loud dripping noise started every time that pipe was used. The room had no luxuries like a hook to hang my wet towel on.During my stay the entire house lost water for two days. Walking 20 minutes in the morning (to my workplace) just to brush my teeth and take a shower was not a pleasant experience. I can see how this sort of thing can happen, and the host was very gracious about it, trying to find solutions for the residents. Normally I would not comment about such an unforeseen event, but along with the rest of the renovation, this was a bit too much. We were promised a refund for the 2 days, I'm still waiting for mine. I can see how this place can be great if no renovation is taking place. I think the host should have either shut-down during the renovation, or at least make it explicit in the listing. Giving it 3 starts, as an average between my 1 star experience and the 5 starts it could have been. When I left, they just started tearing apart the upstairs kitchen..."
292,1,2015-09-12,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We spent the week enjoying the beautiful sites, great food and friendly people of Seattle. This place was the perfect base camp. It is clean, cozy and relaxing. We slept great in a very comfortable bed. I loved looking out at the green foliage from the front windows and porch with seating. My brother joined us for one night, and the pullout sofa came in handy. The host was very friendly and accommodating. I definitely recommend staying here."
293,6,2015-09-13,"Very clean and conveniently located studio that meets all your basic needs. The host is very easy to communicate with and accommodating with the check in/out process. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."
294,4,2015-09-13,"Great location and great apt. Will stay there again!!!"
295,1,2015-09-15,"Very easy communication with the host, cute neighborhood, very clean and comfortable space. As mentioned in other reviews, you can hear noise from upstairs, so if you're sensitive to noise it might be problematic. It was ok for us, and the bed was super comfortable - we had a wonderful stay. Beautiful little porch / outdoor space as well. Super easy and quick to get downtown on the D Rapid Line. Highly recommend this space!"
296,5,2015-09-15,"The host was very helpful as I told her we would be coming in about noon and leaving for lunch right away. She gave me many places to check out to eat lunch at. We will be back to stay at this rental again."
297,5,2015-09-16,"This place was fantastic for our one night stay - the place was spotless and the area was great too, very close to downtown Seattle. The host was communicative and very accommodating, and if I was coming back to Seattle I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, definitely worth the money."
298,1,2015-09-16,"Great experience. The apartment was as described; very pleasant and private. The host was very professional and prompt in her communication, even accommodating an early check in."
299,8,2015-09-16,"This apartment is amazing. It's right in the Ballard area of Seattle and just blocks from coffee shops, restaurants, and the Sunday Farmers Market! The home itself is very new and clean with all the amenities you could need for stay. The kitchen is awesome (especially if you like to cook)! Looking forward to returning to Seattle and staying here again."
300,5,2015-09-17,"The host had a very beautiful house on Queen Anne. The basement where we stayed was clean and very convenient. We would love to come back again."
301,5,2015-09-19,"The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. We were left stranded in Seattle with no place to stay. Would not recommend."
302,4,2015-09-19,"This place is AMAZING! It's such a beautiful and comfortable apartment. The area is excellent, we found ourselves hanging around the local bars and shops more than downtown Seattle! It's a wonderful place to stay - HIGHLY recommended!"
303,5,2015-09-20,"The host canceled this reservation 1 day before arrival. We were left stranded in Seattle with no place to stay. Would not recommend."
304,8,2015-09-21,"This place was great, very clean and bright (for Seattle at least :)). The Ballard neighborhood was awesome - tons of options to walk to for a cocktail, coffee or a bite to eat. It was also really easy to get downtown on the bus line, which I would recommend for easy and cheap transportation."
305,4,2015-09-21,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. Thighs were clean, bed was comfortable and the TV had an Amazon Fire with all those new fangled subscriptions so we were plenty entertained in our down time."
306,1,2015-09-24,"Very close to delicious restaurants and just a short hop away from downtown. This is a great location! The host was super friendly. We would stay here again."
307,1,2015-09-26,"We had a wonderful stay. Great location. Host was second to none! Would stay here again."
308,4,2015-09-26,"The host was very hospitable and very accommodating. His place was an excellent spot to use as a base for exploring downtown Seattle. We very much appreciated the map with legend and the host's recommendations for where to eat and what to do nearby were excellent. The grocery store, eateries, and bus stops to downtown were all within a 5 minute walk. Our 23 month old especially loved the park a block away. Thank you!"
309,6,2015-09-27,"Place was great. Totally quiet at night! Its like we were the only people there and no noise from the street. Studio was small but clean and cozy. Love the old building and the claw foot tub. Location was a little far away from things walking, and up a hill for those biking, but not too bad. We had a communication breakdown right when we were checking in, but it all worked out."
310,8,2015-09-29,"The house was very comfortable and clean, and beautifully finished. The location was great - very easy to walk to groceries, coffee, restaurants - a highlight of our week in Seattle was waking to see salmon at the salmon ladder. We loved our stay here."
311,6,2015-10-05,"Location was great and is within walking distance or a short bus ride/car ride to Kerry Park, Space Needle and Pike Place. There is also a great view from the apartment itself. Neighborhood felt very safe and was quiet. Room is cozy and is perfect for one or 2 people. It was also very clean and had everything we needed. Great host, super friendly and was very fast to respond. Check in/check out was very easy and the flexible hours were convenient for us. Would recommend to anybody needing a place to stay in Seattle!"
312,4,2015-10-06,"Didn't get to meet the host but his place was perfectly set up. Really comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and a well equipped kitchen. I was able to stream all types of media from his Amazon Fire stick and there were some beers left in the fridge. Great place, perfect Queen Anne locations."
313,4,2015-10-10,"The host is a great host, although we don't have a chance to meet. He is really nice and reasonable host. His response is always quickly no matter what question I have. And even if I have to cancel the reservation due to some reason, he is willing to give me the full refund. Overall, it was a great experience."
314,7,2015-10-12,"The host was fantastic and a good resource to all things Queen Anne/Seattle. The neighborhood is VERY walkable and public transportation is accessible. The living space was extremely comfortable and well appointed. I would highly recommend this apartment!"
315,8,2015-10-14,"This home was so clean, well maintained and beautifully renovated....exactly how its portrayed....very welcoming and comfortable!! Our Host was great!! He met us at the house when we arrived and gave us a run through on how things worked and answered all of our questions...the host is always just a phone call away if you need anything. The location in Ballard is perfect....a beautiful quiet neighborhood and walking distance to everything!!! There is no off street parking but no problem...we never had a problem finding a parking space in front of the house or just a couple of houses down (the host did let us know about the parking before we arrived but like I said it was not a problem)!! Next trip to Seattle, we would love to stay here again!!!"
316,4,2015-10-15,"Accurate listing, frictionless check-in/out with key box. Didn't meet the host, but he was quick to respond to emails and provided everything we needed for our stay. Got in late and was surprised how quite, and residential the neighborhood was. The next morning realized that it was a 2.5 short block walk to a main drag with lots of good restaurants, two grocery stores, etc. Great spot."
317,6,2015-10-17,"Great neighborhood, but the \patio\ photo was misleading. There was no table and chair(s) - you have to climb out a window onto a roof that can be accessed by several other windows, so limited privacy.It would have been helpful to know before booking that there was no coffee maker, toaster, or microwave and that parking can be difficult.Comfy bed, though."
318,1,2015-10-17,"We loved the space. It's very private and close to Queen Ann and Ballard. I enjoyed playing the well kept par 3 golf course just across the street. We were quite comfortable and will absolutely return."
319,10,2015-10-17,"We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to others or return ourselves. The house was plenty of space, warm, welcoming, comfortable and clean/ tidy. The location was perfect for public transit to the city and walking to restaurants and shopping. We loved Ballard ! The essence of a rental !"
320,4,2015-10-19,"This place is in a great location, tons of shops and restaurants just blocks away! We had a great stay here and I would definitely recommend it."
321,7,2015-10-20,"The host was very accommodating and the studio was in a great location and neighbourhood. Studio was everything as described and felt very homely. Just what I needed after staying in so many hotels! Walking distance to Kerry Park, restaurants, shops and bus lines. I've also walked as far as downtown from the studio. Overall, perfect experience and would stay here again!"
322,8,2015-10-21,"Our host was in continual contact as we needed information, leading up to our arrival. The place looked great in the internet and was even better than what we expected. The neighborhood, which we already knew, was great."
323,9,2015-10-26,"I loved staying in this adorable apartment with her sweet cats that kept me company. Walking distance to a ton of delicious and fun restaurants and bars, this neigborhood is great and easily accessible from other parts of Seattle. Host was a wonderful host - filling the room with an abundance of snacks and amenities and thoughtfully offered helpful advice and directions to get to know the area."
324,8,2015-10-29,"We absolutely LOVED our stay in this beautiful home. The high quality kitchen, comfy beds, and ample living space made for a perfect home away from home for our family of 5. Very clean and comfortable. The host was kind to check in about our needs for our new baby and offered a pack n play and crib in advance of our stay. The location was perfect for us and allowed for a walkable experience with our kids (coffee shop 2 blocks away, restaurants close by). Found street parking within a 1/2 block easily each day. The only thing that was a little tricky for our family was the number of stairs for lugging all of our suitcases and gear for the kids, and our big stroller- stairs to the front door followed by a steep set of stairs to access the house, and another set of stairs to get to the bedrooms. We arrived later than we wanted to due to a less than happy baby, and hoped that we didn't wake our hosts with our many trips up and down the stairs to get everything in. That said, we would LOVE to stay here whenever we visit Seattle and would happily negotiate those stairs for such a sweet spot. The elevation is what provides the view and the sunny perch with peak a boo views of the space needle and surrounding areas. Gorgeous. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! Fantastic spot."
325,4,2015-11-02,"Great, spacious, modern apartment, with everything you need, (including a cold beer in the fridg). Parking out front.Super location, easy walk to the heart of Queen Anne where there are great restaurants (Betty restaurant for one) and bars (try Paragon). From there its a easy bus ride ( or walk) to everything Seattle has to offer."
326,9,2015-11-02,"The host was fantastic. She responded to our request within minutes and had great communication leading up to our stay. We picked her place because it was in the heart of the Ballard neighborhood. We were just a few blocks away from lovely bars and restaurants. The room was just as pictured and even more! A very comfortable bed with plenty of closet space. The host added lots of extras in the room such as snacks, bottled waters, toiletries and a coffee maker. She was friendly and easy to chat with and gave us good directions to all the hot spots down the block. A Five Star experience for a fraction of the price... I'd definitely visit again!"
327,1,2015-11-04,"Nice, quiet location close to downtown Seattle. Apt was clean and had nice light. Kitchen had all I needed to cook which was a great $ saver! Recommended!"
328,1,2015-11-08,"Just like others have said, perfect location. Everything is under 10 mins (including the space needle!)from the apt, can't get much better than that! The place is so cute, and has a view overlooking the city. Loved it would def stay again."
329,1,2015-11-09,"Thank you for letting us stay at your gorgeous apartment. This is one of the nicest places I've retired to while traveling. I recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay here."
330,1,2015-11-13,"Clean, beautiful accommodations in a quiet Seattle neighborhood with easy access to great restaurants and bars and downtown nightlife."
331,1,2015-11-14,"Our stay was extremely short, we were only at the rental for one night. The place was a little difficult to find, especially in the dark & rain, but the host's directions made it much easier to find. The place was cozy and looks exactly like the photos. It was a little hard to find parking but I'd chalk that up to a late night arrival on a Friday night. If you're looking for a cozy place, not too far from downtown Seattle, I'd recommend this place."
332,6,2015-11-16,"The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival without first talking to us. We were left stranded in Seattle with no place to stay. Would not recommend."
333,9,2015-11-17,"This place has a gracious and wonderful host. Her space was very inviting, and her amenities in the room were truly a step above and beyond. Communication was great, and made the experience as good as it possibly could have been. It was so pleasant to sit down, and share conversation about my trip, and get good ideas of things to do from the host. Also, her movie room is really awesome."
334,4,2015-11-18,"My husband, baby girl, and I had a great stay in this basement apartment. He was an excellent host and checked in with me via text message to see how our stay was going. The apartment was great for what we needed, nothing super fancy but cute decor, spacious, a washer and dryer, fully functional kitchen, and a parking spot! It's in a nice area with plenty of restaurants nearby and it's only a short drive to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and downtown shopping."
335,9,2015-11-20,"The room was cute and cosy and was in a perfect Ballard location. The host was very welcoming and friendly and made us feel at home while also giving us space when needed. I would definitely recommend this place - especially if you like hilarious cats."
336,1,2015-11-23,"The host's apartment was great and has a fantastic host. A couple of days before we arrived the host sent us detailed instructions to help us find the place and always responded promptly to all correspondence.The apartment itself was lovely. Stylish and well furnished. It would be fantastic for 2 people but did the job fine for the 4 of us with a really nice double bedroom and a comfy fold out sofa in the living room. The location is amazing. 10 minutes walk up the hill is Queen Anne and then Ballard is a 5 minute drive north. Both are great neighbourhoods for shopping and eating/drinking. Downtown is 10 minutes south. Buses either way are a 5 minute walk away."
337,2,2015-11-25,"Place was very nice to come to after a long journey, and it immediately felt cozy and nice. It was very clean and open, and the check in was smooth. She had left fresh towels and a nice bag of soaps, and we immediately felt at home. It was super convenient to get to and was very nicely situated in a great neighbourhood with lots of close amenities. Great coffee shop 2 blocks away, and a nice breakfast joint as well. There is a Whole Foods just down the hill which we walked to a few times. Also i have to say that she was nice to converse with and easy to ask questions to and the booking process was very accommodating. We had a great stay, and we would definitely stay here again. We definitely can recommend this place!"
338,1,2015-11-27,"Great place! Very comfortable space & comfy bed! Thank you for providing a nice, private getaway!"
339,10,2015-11-29,"Everything was warm and welcoming. The host made sure we got settled in. Perfect experience!"
340,9,2015-12-05,"Pretty much the perfect host. And she has pretty much thought of everything. The room (and bed, most importantly) is comfortable, light (it's a corner space with windows on two sides), and I appreciated the desk space, as I was in town to work. But she goes beyond expectations. She has stocked a bottom drawer full of things you might need, from snacks to toiletries, all, it would seem, complimentary. There is an iron and small ironing board in the closet, which was again appreciated. There is tea, coffee, a coffee machine, and even a selection of pens and Seattle postcards. OK, if you don't like cats or sharing the adjacent bathroom, then I can see this rental might not be ideal. For everyone else though, this is a good value, excellently located, and utterly charming place to stay."
341,1,2015-12-06,"Amazing place in a great location. Highly recommend."
343,9,2015-12-07,"My boyfriend and I considered staying in a hotel for our anniversary weekend, and we both agree that this place was better than any hotel we could have picked. From the moment she accepted our request to stay (which she did both promptly and kindly) we felt welcome in her home. Her apartment is literally the best apartment we have ever been in. It's charming, beautifully decorated, warm, and bright. The host provides more amenities than most hotels, including snacks, coffee, and miscellaneous items like hair ties and deodorant. She also provided maps of Ballard and several books/lists listing local attractions and food. Before our visit, the host advised us to bring some warm clothes as her apartment got a little chilly at night, which proved to be good advice. We were never uncomfortable, however, thanks to the space heater and blankets provided in the guest room. We loved hanging out with her two cats. Her projector is awesome; we watched \American Hustle\ and \Sleepless in Seattle\ (obviously!), and we easily could have spent the whole weekend holed up on her couch with her impressive DVD collection. The host is wonderful. She gave us plenty of space and privacy, but was also open to hanging out and talking with us. Playing with her cats and talking about movies with her was one of the highlights of our trip. We were impressed with how she communicated with us before the trip, giving us all the information we needed before we needed it. She responds quickly to messages and texts. The trip was fun, relaxing, and non-stressful. We would rent her guest room again in a heartbeat. Thanks for such an awesome experience!"
344,9,2015-12-13,"A great host. She was very welcoming, and her place was clean and comfortable. Street parking near her place was easy to find and we couldn't have asked to be in a better location. The house was in walking distance of some great coffee, food and shopping. If we went back to Seattle we know where we'd want to stay! Oh, and the cats were great too!"
345,1,2015-12-17,"The host's place is wonderful and exactly as described, and she provided very clear directions on how to find and access the apartment. Clean, well-furnished, quiet, and comfortable! Perfect!"
346,4,2015-12-19,"This place was perfect for my parents' visit. The space was spacious, very clean and the neighbourhood was lovely! The host checked in to make sure they were okay and didn't need anything; very kind of him! I'll definitely send other guests his way."
347,9,2015-12-21,"This home and our bedroom were lovely. Very clean and lots of charm! The bedroom had a variety of amenities like coffee and Seattle-related information. She was home when we got there, but was flexible in leaving a key outside for us since we didn't know when we were arriving. The bedroom can get a little chilly, but two heaters were provided to heat it up! Also, it's in a nice neighborhood and their are restaurants within walking distance. Overall a great experience."
348,1,2015-12-22,"The apartment was perfect for our stay! It was clean and ready on time and very comfortable. I imagine the porch would be very nice in the warmer months to enjoy an afternoon, but we were there in December! The location was great!"
349,4,2015-12-22,"The whole set is cute and comfortable. Warm in such a raining whether. Different kinds of cooking tools look good though I did not have time to cook. The surroundings are really quiet, safe and convenient."
350,1,2015-12-24,"The home is a little tricky to find because of Seattle's streets, but following the directions closely gets you there. It's very easy to access once you're there, and it's easy to check-in and check-out at one's convenience. Everything inside was as described. If I had to complain about something, it'd be that it was a bit far to walk to places in the cold weather. That said, the place was great, and the location information is accurate - I would stay again in the summer. Highly recommended!"
351,7,2015-12-31,"The host made us feel very welcome and was very easy to contact for any information we needed. Parking was included and the studio apartment had everything we needed. Its location was ideal and within easy walking distance to the commercial district of Queen Anne."
352,4,2016-01-01,"We had everything we needed in this apartment, and he always made himself available in case of questions or problems. It was a quiet, cozy place to come back to at the end of a busy day. The Queen Anne neighborhood is safe and friendly, and conveniently close to downtown. Highly recommend."
353,6,2016-01-02,"This place was perfect for us - compact, but with everything we needed, in a charmingly converted hotel building. Check-in and out was easy, Great host!"
354,1,2016-01-02,"The place was wonderful! It was a bit hard to find at night, however the listing is strategically located in Seattle. The place itself really feels like home; it is clean, comfortable, and just as described."
