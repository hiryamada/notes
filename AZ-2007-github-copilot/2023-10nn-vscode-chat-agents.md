# Chat agents

https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_84#_chat-agents


This iteration, we built a new way to interact with Copilot Chat: agents. Agents are like experts who have a specialty that they can help you with, and you can talk to them in the chat by mentioning them with the @ symbol. Currently, there are two agents:

@workspace has context about the code in your workspace and can help you navigate it, finding relevant files or classes.
@vscode knows about commands and features in the VS Code editor itself, and can help you use them.
