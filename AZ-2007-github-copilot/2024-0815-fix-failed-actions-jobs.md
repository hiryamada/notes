you can now ask Copilot Chat in GitHub.com questions about failed Actions jobs. 

With this feature, you can now speed up your pull request review cycle by asking Copilot about build failures to quickly get them resolved. In addition, weâ€™ve added a quality improvement to how Copilot Chat in GitHub.com handles complex questions. This internal improvement will help you get the most out of your Copilot Chat conversations. Both of these features are in beta.
