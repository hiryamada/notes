This is a concluded exploration by GitHub Next.
The Copilot for CLI technical preview ended on March 21, 2024.

Copilot for CLI provides three shell commands: ??, git? and gh?:

??: It will compose commands and loops, and throw around obscure find flags to satisfy your query.
git? is used for searching specifically for git invocations.
gh? combines the power of the GitHub CLI command and query interface with the convenience of having AI generate the complicated flags and jq expressions for you

■GitHub Copilot in the CLI
GitHub Copilot in the CLI is an extension for GitHub CLI which provides a chat-like interface in the terminal that allows you to ask questions about the command line. 
You can ask Copilot in the CLI to suggest a command for your use case with gh copilot suggest, or to explain a command you're curious about with gh copilot explain.
