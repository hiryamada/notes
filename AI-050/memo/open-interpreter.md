OpenAI's release of **Code Interpreter** with GPT-4 presents a fantastic opportunity to accomplish real-world tasks with ChatGPT.

However, OpenAI's service is hosted, closed-source, and heavily restricted:

- No internet access.
- Limited set of pre-installed packages.
- 100 MB maximum upload, 120.0 second runtime limit.
- State is cleared (along with any generated files or links) when the environment dies.
